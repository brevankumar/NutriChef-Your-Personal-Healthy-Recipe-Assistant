At a glance, the graphic features examples of best-choice foods to inspire the selection of healthy meals and snacks, and it emphasizes physical activity as part of the equation for staying healthy.\n\n\u00a0\nBuilding a healthy and balanced diet\nEating a variety of foods keeps our meals interesting and flavorful. It\u2019s also the key to a healthy and balanced diet because each food has a unique mix of nutrients\u2014both mac\u00adronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). The Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate provides a blueprint to help us make the best eating choices.\nAlong with filling half of our plate with colorful vegetables and fruits (and choosing them as snacks), split the other half between whole grains and healthy protein:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more veggies \u2013 and the greater the variety \u2013 the better.\nPotatoes and French fries don\u2019t count as vegetables because of their negative impact on blood sugar.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on vegetables >\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEat plenty of fruits of all colors.\nChoose whole fruits or sliced fruits (rather than fruit juices; limit fruit juice to one small glass per day).\n\n\n\nMore on fruits >\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGo for whole grains or foods made with minimally processed whole grains. The less processed the grains, the better.\nWhole grains\u2014whole wheat, brown rice, quinoa, and foods made with them, such as whole-grain pasta and 100% whole-wheat bread\u2014have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than white rice, bread, pizza crust, pasta, and other refined grains.\n\n\n\nMore on whole grains >\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChoose beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and other plant-based healthy protein options, as well as fish, eggs, and poultry.\nLimit red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and avoid processed meats (bacon, deli meats, hot dogs, sausages).\n\n\n\nMore on healthy protein >\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that fat is a necessary part of our diet, and what matters most is the type of fat we eat. We should regularly choose foods with healthy unsaturated fats (such as fish, nuts, seeds, and healthy oils from plants), limit foods high in saturated fat (especially red meat), and avoid unhealthy trans fats (from partially hydrogenated oils):\n\n\n\n\nUse healthy oils from plants like extra virgin olive, canola, corn, sunflower, and peanut oil in cooking, on salads and vegetables, and at the table.\nLimit butter to occasional use.\n\n\n\nMore on healthy oils and healthy fats >\n\u00a0\nDairy foods are needed in smaller amounts than other foods on our plate:",

It\u2019s also sugar-free, and as easy to find as the nearest tap.\nLimit juice\u2014which can have as much sugar as soda\u2014to one small glass per day, and avoid sugary drinks like sodas, fruit drinks, and sports drinks, which provide a lot of calories and virtually no other nutrients. Over time, drinking sugary drinks can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other problems.\n\n\n\nMore on water and choosing healthy drinks >\n\u00a0\nFinally, just like choosing the right foods, incorporating physical activity into our day by staying active is part of the recipe for keeping healthy:\n\n\n\n\nTrade inactive \u201csit-time\u201d for \u201cfit-time.\u201d\nChildren and adolescents should aim for at least one hour of physical activity per day, and they don\u2019t need fancy equipment or a gym\u2014The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggest choosing unstructured activities for children such as playing tug-of-war, or having fun using playground equipment.\n\n\n\nMore on staying active >\n\u00a0\nOverall, the main message is to focus on diet quality.\n\nThe type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate\u2014like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans\u2014are much healthier than sugar, \u00a0potatoes, and foods made from white flour.\nThe Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate does not include sugary drinks, sweets, and other junk foods. These are not everyday foods and should be eaten only rarely, if ever.\nThe Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate encourages the use of healthy oils in place of other types of fat.\n\n\nAbout the Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate\nThe Kid\u2019s Healthy Eating Plate was created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H.

Translations of the Healthy Eating Plate are also available in over 25 languages.\nBuilding a Healthy and Balanced Diet\nMake most of your meal vegetables and fruits \u2013 \u00bd of your plate.\nAim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don\u2019t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar.\nGo for whole grains \u2013 \u00bc of your plate.\nWhole and intact grains\u2014whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta\u2014have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains.\nProtein power \u2013 \u00bc of your plate.\nFish, poultry, beans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources\u2014they can be mixed into salads, and pair well with vegetables on a plate. Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage.\nHealthy plant oils \u2013 in moderation.\nChoose healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember that low-fat does not mean \u201chealthy.\u201d\nDrink water, coffee, or tea.\nSkip sugary drinks, limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, and limit juice to a small glass per day.\nStay active.\nThe red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate\u2019s placemat is a reminder that staying active is also important in weight control.\nThe main message of the Healthy Eating Plate is to focus on diet quality:\n\nThe type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate\u2014like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans\u2014are healthier than others.\nThe Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoid sugary beverages, a major source of calories\u2014usually with little nutritional value\u2014in the American diet.\nThe Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to use healthy oils, and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA.\n\nYour Plate and the PlanetJust as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Food production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and it places an enormous demand upon our earth\u2019s natural resources.\nLearn about the impacts of the foods on your plate\nYour Questions Answered\n\n\nAre the relative sizes of the Healthy Eating Plate sections based on calories or volume?\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate does not define a certain number of calories or servings per day from each food group. The relative section sizes suggest approximate relative proportions of each of the food groups to include on a healthy plate. They are not based on specific calorie amounts, and they are not meant to prescribe a certain number of calories or servings per day, since individuals\u2019 calorie and nutrient needs vary based on age, gender, body size, and level of activity.",
        "bdf6730f-06d3-402d-b938-cec57b3fa577": "Are the relative sizes of the Healthy Eating Plate sections based on calories or volume?\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate does not define a certain number of calories or servings per day from each food group.

Although our translations of this guide maintain the single-plate graphic, we encourage its use for creating healthy, balanced meals in context of cultural and individual customs and preferences.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about alcohol? Isn\u2019t alcohol supposed to be good for you in small amounts?\n\nFor some people, moderate alcohol consumption can offer health benefits, whereas for others alcohol may pose risks. Learn more about the\u00a0risks and benefits of alcohol.\n\n\n\n\nWho created the Healthy Eating Plate?\nThe Healthy Eating Plate, created by nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and editors at Harvard Health Publications, was designed to address deficiencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2019s MyPlate. The Healthy Eating Plate provides detailed guidance, in a simple format, to help people make the best eating choices.\nThe Healthy Eating Plate is based exclusively on the best available science and was not subjected to political or commercial pressures from food industry lobbyists. Learn more about how the Healthy Eating Plate compares to the USDA\u2019s MyPlate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the Healthy Eating Pyramid? Will it be going away?\n\nGenerations of Americans are accustomed to the food pyramid design, and it\u2019s not going away. In fact, the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate complement each other. See how you can use the Healthy Eating Pyramid as a guide for your grocery shopping list.\n\n\n\n\nWill following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate guidelines really make me healthier?\n\nAccording to research done at Harvard Chan School of Public Health and elsewhere [1-3], following the guidelines presented through the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate can lead to a lower risk of heart disease and premature death:\n\nIn the 1990s, the USDA\u2019s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion created the Healthy Eating Index \u201cto measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns.\u201d [4] A score of 100 meant following the federal recommendations to the letter while a score of 0 meant totally ignoring them.\nTo see how well the principles embodied in the Healthy Eating Pyramid stacked up against the government\u2019s advice, researchers at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health created an Alternate Healthy Eating Index with a scoring system similar to the USDA\u2019s index. They then compared the two indexes, using information about daily diets collected from more than 100,000 female nurses and male health professionals taking part in two long-term studies.\n\nThe eleven components assessed by the Alternate Healthy Eating Index were dairy products; vegetables; fruit; nuts & seeds; bread/grains; meat, poultry & fish; cholesterol; fat; sodium; alcohol; and multivitamins.",
        "dcc1a21e-71e5-46bb-a430-eec0226a2b56": "Men who scored highest on the USDA\u2019s original Healthy Eating Index (meaning their diets most closely followed federal recommendations) reduced their overall risk of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic disease by 11% over 8 to 12 years of follow-up compared to those who scored lowest. Women who most closely followed the government\u2019s recommendations were only 3% less likely to have developed a chronic disease. [5]\nIn comparison, scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index did appear to correlate more closely with better health in both sexes. Men with high scores (those whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines) were 20% less likely to have developed a major chronic disease than those with low scores. Women with high scores lowered their overall risk by 11%. Men whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by almost 40%; women with high scores lowered their risk by almost 30%.\nIn a 2014 study looking at trends in diet quality among adults in the U.S., researchers using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index found that there was steady improvement from 1999 to 2010, but that overall dietary quality remains poor. [6]\n\n\n\nTwo studies offer further evidence of the disease prevention benefits that accrue from following a diet similar to one based on the Healthy Eating Pyramid:\n\nA study that tracked 7,319 British civil servants for 18 years found that men and women with the highest scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index had a 25% lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 42% lower risk of dying from heart disease, than people with the lowest scores. [3]\nAnother observational study in 93,676 post-menopausal women found that following a Healthy Eating Pyramid-style diet (as measured by adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was superior to following a low-fat diet at lowering cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk.

We suggest drinking water instead of sugary beverages, and we also address common dietary concerns such as salt and sodium, vitamins, and alcohol. It\u2019s also important to stay active and maintain a healthy weight.\nThe main message: Focus on diet quality\n\nThe type of carbohydrate in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrate in the diet, because some sources of carbohydrate\u2014like vegetables (other than potatoes), fruits, whole grains, and beans\u2014are healthier than others.\nThe Healthy Eating Plate also advises consumers to avoid sugary beverages, a major source of calories\u2014usually with little nutritional value\u2014in the American diet.\nThe Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to use healthy oils, and it does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat. In this way, the Healthy Eating Plate recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA.\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate summarizes the best evidence-based dietary information available today. As nutrition researchers are continually discovering valuable information, The Healthy Eating Plate will be updated to reflect new findings.\nWant to learn more?

Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is the fiber-rich outer layer that supplies B vitamins, iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.\nThese components have various effects on our bodies:\n\nBran and fiber slow the breakdown of starch into glucose\u2014thus maintaining a steady blood sugar rather than causing sharp spikes.\nFiber helps lower cholesterol as well as move waste through the digestive tract.\nFiber may also help prevent the formation of small blood clots that can trigger heart attacks or strokes.\nPhytochemicals and essential minerals such as magnesium, selenium and copper found in whole grains may protect against some cancers.\n\nThe invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat\u2019s B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.\nA growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out our\u00a0Carbohydrate Guide.\nThe 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]\u00a0However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:\n\n\n\nAmaranth\nKamut\n\u00a0Spelt\n\n\nBarley\nMillet\n\u00a0Teff\n\n\nBrown Rice\nQuinoa\n\u00a0Triticale\n\n\nBuckwheat\n\u00a0Rye\n\u00a0Wheat Berries\n\n\nBulgur\n\u00a0Oats\n\u00a0Wild Rice\n\n\nCorn\n\u00a0Sorghum",

The stamp, while designed to steer consumers towards healthy whole grains, identified products with more fiber and less sodium and trans fat but that were higher in sugar and calories than whole grain foods without the stamp.\nThe other three USDA criteria\u00a0had mixed results in identifying healthier whole grain products, but (criterion 4) the carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio of less than 10:1 proved to be the most effective measure of healthfulness. However, it is unclear whether this ratio is more predictive of chronic disease risk than other measures of carbohydrate quality\u2014such as the amount/type of fiber or overall dietary glycemic index/load. Foods that met this criterion were higher in fiber and less likely to contain trans fats, sodium, and sugar.\n\n\nBecause calculating the carbohydrate-to-fiber\u00a0ratio may be difficult and not readily available for a consumer reading a label, the study suggests that labeling guidelines appearing on whole-grain foods should be improved.\n\nConsumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their\u00a0whole\u00a0forms\u2014such as brown rice, barley, oats, corn, and rye\u2014are healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients.\nWhole Grains and Disease\nAs researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning that\u00a0the quality of the carbohydrates\u00a0you eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health.\u00a0[3]\n\nA report from the Iowa Women\u2019s Health Study linked whole grain consumption with fewer deaths from inflammatory and infectious causes, excluding cardiac and cancer causes. Examples are rheumatoid arthritis, gout, asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. Compared with women who rarely or never ate whole-grain foods, those who had at least two or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have died from an inflammation-related condition over a 17-year period.\u00a0[4]\nA meta-analysis combining results from studies conducted in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Scandinavian countries (which included health information from over 786,000 individuals), found that people who ate 70 grams/day of whole grains\u2014compared with those who ate little or no whole grains\u2014had a 22%\u00a0lower risk of total mortality, a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, and a 20% lower risk of cancer mortality.\u00a0[5]\n\nCardiovascular Disease\nEating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.\n\nIn the Harvard-based Nurses\u2019 Health Study, women who ate 2 to 3 servings of whole-grain products each day were 30% less likely to have a heart attack or die from heart disease over a 10-year period than women who ate less than 1 serving per week.\u00a0[6]\nA meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21% less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week. [7]\n\nType 2 Diabetes\nReplacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes.",
        "535fd45f-d79a-4442-b4ab-c394a5aa971f": "[6]\nA meta-analysis of seven major studies showed that cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) was 21% less likely in people who ate 2.5 or more servings of whole-grain foods a day compared with those who ate less than 2 servings a week. [7]\n\nType 2 Diabetes\nReplacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8]\u00a0In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients.\n\nIn a study of more than 160,000 women whose health and dietary habits were followed for up to 18 years, those who averaged 2 to 3 servings of whole grains a day were 30% less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains. [9]\u00a0When the researchers combined these results with those of several other large studies, they found that eating an extra 2 servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21%.\nA follow-up to that study including men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found that swapping white rice for whole grains could help lower diabetes risk. Those who ate the most white rice\u2014five or more servings a week\u2014had a 17% higher risk of diabetes than those who ate white rice less than one time a month. Those who ate the most brown rice\u2014two or more servings a week\u2014had an 11% lower risk of diabetes than those who rarely ate brown rice. Researchers estimate that swapping whole grains in place of even some white rice could lower diabetes risk by 36%. [10]\nA large study of more than 72,000 postmenopausal women without diabetes at the start of the study found that the higher the intake of whole grains, the greater the risk reduction of type 2 diabetes. A 43% reduced risk was found in women eating the highest amount of whole grains (2 or more servings daily) as compared with those who ate no whole grains. [11]\n\nCancer\nThe data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13]\n\nA large five-year study among nearly 500,000 men and women suggests that eating whole grains, but not dietary fiber, offers modest protection against colorectal cancer. [14,15]\u00a0A review of four large population studies also showed a protective effect of whole grains from colorectal cancer, with a cumulative risk reduction of 21%.\u00a0[16]\n\nDigestive Health\nBy keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines.\u00a0[17]\n\nA study of 170,776 women followed for more than 26 years looked at the effect of different dietary fibers, including that from whole grains, on Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Though a reduced risk of Crohn\u2019s disease was found in those eating high intakes of fruit fiber, there was no reduced risk of either disease found from eating whole grains.\u00a0[18]\n\nSome grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives\u2014without any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims.

Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods. \nJump to:\n\u2013What is protein?\n\u2013How much protein do I need?\n\u2013It\u2019s all about the protein \u201cpackage\u201d\n\u2013Research on protein and human health\n\u2013Protein foods and the planet\n\u2013The bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods\n\u2013[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge!\nWhat Is Protein?\nProtein is found throughout the body\u2014in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.\nProtein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don\u2019t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids\u2014histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine\u2014known as the\u00a0essential\u00a0amino acids, must come from food.\nHow Much Protein Do I Need?\nThe National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, or just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1]\n\nFor a 140-pound person, that means about 50 grams of protein each day.\nFor a 200-pound person, that means about 70 grams of protein each day.\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake\u2014anywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there\u2019s relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.",
        "dec3c902-58c5-4372-801a-6363126b3763": "What are \u201ccomplete\u201d proteins, and how much do I need?\n\u201cPure\u201d protein, whether derived from plant or animal foods, probably has similar effects on health, although the mix of amino acids can have health implications. Some proteins found in food are \u201ccomplete,\u201d meaning they contain all twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein in the body. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more of the nine essential amino acids, which our bodies can\u2019t make from scratch or from other amino acids. Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose\u00a0to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don\u2019t get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreased immunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.\nHowever, it\u2019s uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there\u2019s an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3]\nIt\u2019s All About the Protein \u201cPackage\u201d\nWhen we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It\u2019s this protein\u00a0\u201cpackage\u201d\u00a0that\u2019s likely to make a difference for health.\nThe table below shows a sample of food \u201cpackages\u201d sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it.\n\n\nTable: Comparing protein packages\n\n\n\n\n\nTo call out a few examples:\n\nA 4-ounce broiled sirloin steak is a great source of protein\u2014about 33 grams worth. But it also delivers about 5 grams of saturated fat.\nA 4-ounce ham steak with 22 grams of protein has only 1.6 grams of saturated fat, but it\u2019s loaded with 1,500 milligrams worth of sodium.\n4 ounces of grilled sockeye salmon has about 30 grams of protein, naturally low in sodium, and contains just over 1 gram of saturated fat. Salmon and other fatty fish are also excellent sources of omega-3 fats, a type of fat that\u2019s especially good for the heart.\nA cup of cooked lentils provides about 18 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber, and it has virtually no saturated fat or sodium.\n\nWhat about protein powders? Powdered protein can come from a variety of sources, including\u00a0eggs,\u00a0milk\u00a0(e.g., casein, whey), and plants (e.g.,\u00a0soybeans,\u00a0peas, hemp). Some protein powders contain protein from multiple sources; for instance, a vegan option might include protein derived from peas, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and alfalfa. Like other dietary supplements, protein powders are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety. They can often contain non-protein ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, thickeners,\u00a0added sugars,\u00a0non-caloric sweeteners, and artificial flavoring. If you choose to consume protein powder, it is important to read the nutrition and ingredient labels beforehand, as products may contain unexpected ingredients and large amounts of added sugars and calories.\nLearn more about protein powders and other workout supplements\nResearch on Protein and Health\nAvailable evidence indicates that it\u2019s\u00a0the source of protein (or, the protein \u201cpackage\u201d), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here\u2019s the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.",
        "c0b85ab3-afd8-45b6-8ddb-897ea6324a32": "Heart disease\nResearch conducted at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat\u2014especially processed red meat\u2014on a regular basis is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. [4-6] Conversely, replacing red and processed red meat with healthy protein sources such as beans, soy foods, nuts, fish, or poultry seems to reduce these risks. One of the reasons why plant sources of protein are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to protein from red meat and dairy is because of the different types of fat in these protein packages. Plant-based protein sources are more unsaturated, which lowers LDL cholesterol\u2014an established risk factor for heart disease. Also, plant sources contain no cholesterol. Other factors are likely to contribute to the lower risk, but this is a key factor.\n\nOne investigation followed 120,000 men and women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study for more than two decades. For every additional 3-ounce serving of unprocessed red meat the study participants consumed each day, their risk of dying from cardiovascular disease increased by 13%.\u00a0[5]\n\nProcessed red meat was even more strongly linked to dying from cardiovascular disease\u2014and in smaller amounts: every additional 1.5 ounce serving of processed red meat consumed each day (equivalent to one hot dog or two strips of bacon) was linked to a 20% increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease death.\nCutting back on red meat could save lives: the researchers estimated that if all the men and women in the study had reduced their total red and processed red meat intake to less than half a serving a day, one in ten cardiovascular disease deaths would have been prevented.\n\n\nIn another study of 43,000 men that looked at both amount and sources of protein found that intake of total protein was minimally associated with heart disease risk, but intake of protein from red meat was associated with higher risk. [7]",
        "e47ebefc-399f-4978-94d7-645900bf2725": "In another study of 43,000 men that looked at both amount and sources of protein found that intake of total protein was minimally associated with heart disease risk, but intake of protein from red meat was associated with higher risk. [7]\n\n\nAnother study\u2014the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials looking at the health effects of red meat by substituting it for other specific types of foods\u2014found that diets that replaced red meat with healthy plant proteins led to decreases in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. [28]\n\nThe study included data from 36 randomized controlled trials involving 1,803 participants. The researchers compared people who ate diets with red meat with people who ate more of other types of foods (i.e. chicken, fish, carbohydrates, or plant proteins such as legumes, soy, or nuts), looking at blood concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and blood pressure\u2014all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\nResearchers found that when diets with red meat were compared with all other types of diets combined, there were no significant differences in total cholesterol, lipoproteins, or blood pressure, although diets higher in red meat did lead to higher triglyceride concentrations than the comparison diets.\nHowever, researchers found that diets higher in high-quality plant protein sources such as legumes, soy, and nuts resulted in lower levels of both total and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat.\n\nIn terms of the\u00a0amount\u00a0of protein consumed, there\u2019s evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet may be beneficial for the heart, as long as the protein comes from a healthy source.\n\nA 20-year prospective study of over 80,000 women found that those who ate low-carbohydrate diets that were high in plant-based sources of fat and protein had a 30%lower risk of heart disease compared with women who ate high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets. [8] However, eating a low-carbohydrate diet high in animal fat or protein did not offer such protection.\nFurther evidence of the heart benefits of eating healthy protein in place of carbohydrate comes from a randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart). A healthy diet that replaced some carbohydrate with healthy protein (or healthy fat) did a better job of lowering blood pressure and harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than a higher carbohydrate diet. [9]\nSimilarly, the \u201cEcoAtkins\u201d weight loss trial compared a low-fat, high -carbohydrate, vegetarian diet to a low-carbohydrate vegan diet that was high in vegetable protein and fat. Though weight loss was similar on the two diets, study participants on the high protein diet saw improvements in blood lipids and blood pressure. [10]\nOf course, occasionally a study will generate headlines because it found the opposite result. For example, one study of Swedish women who ate low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets had higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than those who ate lower-protein, higher-carbohydrate diets. [11] But the study, which assessed the women\u2019s diets only once and then followed them for 15 years, did not look at what\u00a0types\u00a0of carbohydrates or what\u00a0sources\u00a0of protein these women ate. That was important because most of the women\u2019s protein came from animal sources.",
        "321b5aca-cd10-4221-92ad-43d8d2bcb1df": "Diabetes\nAgain, the source of protein\u00a0matters more than protein\u00a0quantity\u00a0when it comes to diabetes risk. Eating more red meat predicts a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while consuming nuts, legumes, and poultry is related to lower risk.\n\nA 2011 study found that people who ate diets high in red meat, especially processed red meat, had a higher risk of type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate red or processed meat. [12] For each additional serving a day of red meat or processed red meat that study participants ate, their risk of diabetes rose 12% and 32%, respectively. Investigators also found that replacing a serving of red meat with one serving of nuts, low-fat dairy products, or whole grains each day was associated with an estimated 16% to 35% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.\nA related study also found that people who started eating more red meat than usual were had a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes during the next four years, and researchers also found that those who reduced red meat consumption had a 14% lower risk of\u00a0type 2 diabetes over a 10-year follow-up period. [13]\nHow meat is cooked may also affect type 2 diabetes risk. In a study that tracked the health of over 289,000 men and women, researchers found that individuals who most frequently ate red meats and chicken cooked at high temperatures were 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared to those who ate the least. There was also an increased risk of weight gain and developing obesity in the frequent users of high-temperature cooking methods, which may have contributed to the development of diabetes. Of note, this research demonstrated that cooking methods might contribute to diabetes risk beyond the effects of meat consumption alone. [14] Learn more about this study.\nMore evidence that the source of protein matters comes from a 20-year study that looked at the relationship between low-carbohydrate diets and type 2 diabetes in women. Low-carbohydrate diets that were high in vegetable sources of fat and protein were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. [15] But low-carbohydrate diets that were high in animal sources of protein or fat did not show this benefit.\nFor type 1 diabetes (formerly called juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes), proteins found in cow\u2019s milk have been implicated in the development of the disease in babies with a predisposition to the disease, but research remains inconclusive. [16,17]\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer\nWhen it comes to cancer, once again, the source of protein seems to matter more than quantity.\n\nIn the Nurse\u2019s Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, every additional serving per day of red meat or processed red meat was associated with a 10% and 16% higher risk of cancer death, respectively. [5]\nIn October 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded\u00a0that consumption of processed meat is \u201ccarcinogenic to humans,\u201d and that consumption of red meat is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d [18] The IARC Working Group (comprised of 22 scientists from ten countries) reached these conclusions from an evaluation of over 800 studies.\n\nConclusions were primarily based on the evidence for colorectal cancer. Data also showed positive associations between processed meat consumption and stomach cancer, and between red meat consumption and pancreatic and prostate cancer.\n\n\nA 2014 study also found a link between high consumption of red meat during adolescence and premenopausal breast cancer, while higher intakes of poultry, nuts, and legumes were associated with lower risk. Using data on the health of 89,000 women (aged 24 to 43) followed over a 20-year period, researchers found a 22% higher risk of breast cancer in those who ate 1.5 servings of red meat per day while in high school, compared to those who only had one serving per week. Each additional daily serving of red meat seemed to increase the risk of breast cancer by another 13%. \u00a0[19]\nHow meat is cooked may also have implications for cancer risk.

Learn about tips for healthy grilling.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremature death\n\nIn 2016, researchers reviewed protein intakes of more than 131,000 women and men from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. After tracking their diets for up to 32 years, the authors found that a higher intake of red meat, especially processed versions (sausage, bacon, hot dogs, salami), was linked to a modestly higher risk of death, while a higher protein intake from plant foods carried a lower risk. [2] Learn more about this study.\n\n\n\n\n\nBone health\n\nDigesting protein releases acids into the bloodstream, which the body usually neutralizes with calcium and other buffering agents. As a result, early research theorized that eating lots of protein requires a lot more calcium \u2013 which may be pulled from bone. A 2009 systematic review found that this doesn\u2019t appear to happen. [20]\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight control\nThe same healthy protein foods that are good choices for disease prevention may also help with weight control. Again, it\u2019s the source of protein that matters.\n\nResearchers at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health followed the diet and lifestyle habits of over 120,000 men and women for up to 20 years, looking at how small changes contributed to weight gain over time. [21]\n\nThose who ate more red and processed meat over the course of the study gained more weight, about one extra pound every four years, while those who ate more nuts over the course of the study gained\u00a0less\u00a0weight, about a half pound less every four years.\n\n\nA subsequent detailed analysis of this cohort also found that eating red meat, chicken with skin, and regular cheese was associated with greater weight gain. Yogurt, peanut butter, walnuts and other nuts, chicken without skin, low-fat cheese, and seafood was associated with less weight gain. [22]\nAnother study showed that eating around one daily serving of beans, chickpeas, lentils or peas can increase fullness, which may lead to better weight management and weight loss. [23]\n\nThere\u2019s no need to go overboard on protein. Though some studies show benefits of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets in the short term (such as the paleo diet), avoiding fruits and whole grains means missing out on healthful fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients.\n\n\n\n\nOther considerations involving protein\n\nSpecific proteins in food and the environment are involved in food allergies, which are overreactions of the immune system (take gluten and celiac disease, for example).\nMedical journals are also full of reports linking allergic responses to specific protein sources with a variety of conditions (breathing problems, chronic digestive issues, etc.). Eggs, fish, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, and soybeans cause allergic reactions in some people.\nIndividuals diagnosed with certain diseases (such as kidney and liver disease) need to monitor their protein intake according to their physician\u2019s guidelines.\nYou may have also heard that the\u00a0use of antibiotics in the production of animal-based foods has contributed to the emergence of \u201csuperbugs,\u201d or strains of bacteria resistant to currently available antibiotics. In 2016, the FDA announced a voluntary program to limit the routine use of antibiotics in food production (such as giving antibiotics to healthy animals to help them grow faster). [24] As a consumer, you may want to find products \u201craised without antibiotics\u201d if you plan on eating meat. Some companies feature this language on the packaging, others don\u2019t.",
        "fc238e3d-961d-446b-8f8d-7f94f61438e4": "New research highlight: Red meat and diabetes riskPeople who eat just two servings of red meat per week may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people who eat fewer servings, and the risk increases with greater consumption, according to a new study led by researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They also found that replacing red meat with healthy plant-based protein sources, such as nuts and legumes, or modest amounts of dairy foods, was associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.\nRead more\nProtein Foods and the Planet\nJust as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Agriculture is a major contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, the accumulation of which is driving climate change at a rate unprecedented in human history. However, not all foods have an equal impact. Production of animal-based foods tends to have higher GHG emissions than producing plant-based foods\u2014and dairy and especially red meat (particularly beef, lamb, and goat) stand out for their disproportionate impact.\n\n\n\nSource: World Resources Institute, www.wri.org/proteinscorecard\n\n\nTo give you an idea, this \u201cscorecard\u201d from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken\u00a0and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it\u2019s also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.Learn more about the impacts of different foods on your plate.\nBottom Line\nProtein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein \u201cpackages\u201d are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it\u2019s important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That\u2019s why the Healthy Eating Plate encourages choosing healthy protein foods.\nChoose fish, poultry, beans, and nuts; limit red meat and cheese; avoid bacon, cold cuts, and other processed meats.Explore the Healthy Eating Plate\nBuilding off this general guidance, here are some additional details and tips for shaping your diet with the best protein choices:\n\nGet your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no \u201cessential\u201d components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match. Here are some examples for each category:\n\nLegumes: lentils, beans (adzuki, black, fava, chickpeas/garbanzo, kidney,\u00a0 lima, mung, pinto etc.), peas (green, snow, snap, split, etc.), edamame/soybeans (and products made from soy: tofu, tempeh, etc.), peanuts.\nNuts and Seeds: almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans, hemp seeds, squash and pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, chia seeds.\nWhole Grains: kamut, teff, wheat, quinoa, rice, wild rice, millet, oats, buckwheat,\nOther: while many vegetables and fruits contain some level of protein, it\u2019s generally in smaller amounts than the other plant-based foods. Some examples with higher protein quantities include corn, broccoli, asparagus, brussels sprouts, and artichokes.",

Considering the protein package is particularly important when it comes to animal-based foods:\n\nGenerally, poultry (chicken, turkey, duck) and a variety of seafood (fish, crustaceans, mollusks) are your best bet. Eggs can be a good choice, too.\nIf you enjoy dairy foods, it\u2019s best to do so in moderation (think closer to 1-2 servings a day; and incorporating yogurt is probably a better choice than getting all your servings from milk or cheese).\nRed meat\u2014which includes unprocessed beef, pork, lamb, veal, mutton, and goat meat\u2014should be consumed on a more limited basis. If you enjoy red meat, consider eating it in small amounts or only on special occasions.\nProcessed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, sausages, and cold cuts should be avoided. Although these products are often made from red meats, processed meats also include items like turkey bacon, chicken sausage, and deli-sliced chicken and ham. (Processed meat refers to any meat that has been \u201ctransformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation.\u201d [18])\n\n\n\nLooking to reduce red and processed meats, but unsure where to start?

Eat plenty every day.\n\nA diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar, which can help keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote weight loss. [1] Their low glycemic loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase hunger.\nAt least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of beneficial plant chemicals but also creates eye-appealing meals.\nTips to eat more vegetables and fruits each day\n\n Keep fruit where you can see it. Place several ready-to-eat washed whole fruits in a bowl or store chopped colorful fruits in a glass bowl in the refrigerator to tempt a sweet tooth.\n Explore the produce aisle and choose something new. Variety and color are key to a healthy diet. On most days, try to get at least one serving from each of the following categories: dark green leafy vegetables; yellow or orange fruits and vegetables; red fruits and vegetables; legumes (beans) and peas; and citrus fruits.\n Skip the potatoes. Choose other vegetables that are packed with different nutrients and more slowly digested\u00a0carbohydrates.\n Make it a meal. Try cooking new\u00a0recipes that include more vegetables. Salads, soups, and stir-fries are just a few ideas for increasing the number of tasty vegetables in your meals.\n\n\n5 common questions about fruits and vegetables.Have you hesitated to fill your grocery cart with colorful produce because of concerns that pop up in online articles and discussions?Here\u2019s a look at some commonly asked questions, and what the current research says. \n\nVegetables, fruits, and disease\nCardiovascular disease\nThere is compelling evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nA meta-analysis of cohort studies following 469,551 participants found that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, with an average reduction in risk of 4% for each additional serving per day of fruit and vegetables.",
        "0747aa10-723d-49fb-a8d6-b670c38dc72d": "5 common questions about fruits and vegetables.Have you hesitated to fill your grocery cart with colorful produce because of concerns that pop up in online articles and discussions?Here\u2019s a look at some commonly asked questions, and what the current research says. \n\nVegetables, fruits, and disease\nCardiovascular disease\nThere is compelling evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nA meta-analysis of cohort studies following 469,551 participants found that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, with an average reduction in risk of 4% for each additional serving per day of fruit and vegetables. [2]\nThe largest and longest study to date, done as part of the Harvard-based Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, included almost 110,000 men and women whose health and dietary habits were followed for 14 years.\nThe higher the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables, the lower the chances of developing cardiovascular disease. Compared with those in the lowest category of fruit and vegetable intake (less than 1.5 servings a day), those who averaged 8 or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have had a heart attack or stroke. [3]\nAlthough all fruits and vegetables likely contributed to this benefit, green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and mustard greens, were most strongly associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, and kale; and citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit (and their juices) also made important contributions. [3]\nWhen researchers combined findings from the Harvard studies with several other long-term studies in the U.S. and Europe, and looked at coronary heart disease and stroke separately, they found a similar protective effect: Individuals who ate more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day had roughly a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease [4] and stroke, [5] compared with individuals who ate less than 3 servings per day.\n\nBlood pressure\n\nThe\u00a0Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study[6] examined the effect on blood pressure of a diet that was rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and that restricted the amount of saturated and total fat. The researchers found that people with high blood pressure who followed this diet reduced their systolic blood pressure (the upper number of a blood pressure reading) by about 11 mm Hg and their diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) by almost 6 mm Hg\u2014as much as medications can achieve.\nA randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart) showed that this fruit and vegetable-rich diet lowered blood pressure even more when some of the carbohydrate was replaced with healthy unsaturated fat or protein. [7]\nIn 2014 a meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies found that consumption of a vegetarian diet was associated with lower blood pressure. [8]\n\nCancer\nNumerous early studies revealed what appeared to be a strong link between eating fruits and vegetables and protection against cancer. Unlike case-control studies, cohort studies, which follow large groups of initially healthy individuals for years, generally provide more reliable information than case-control studies because they don\u2019t rely on information from the past. And, in general, data from cohort studies have not consistently shown that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables prevents cancer.\n\nFor example, over a 14-year period in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, men and women with the highest intake of fruits and vegetables (8+ servings a day) were just as likely to have developed cancer as those who ate the fewest daily servings (under 1.5). [3]\nA meta-analysis of cohort studies found that a higher fruit and vegetable intake did not decrease the risk of deaths from cancer. [2]\n\nA more likely possibility is that some types of fruits and vegetables may protect against certain cancers.\n\nA study by Farvid and colleagues followed a Nurses\u2019 Health Study II cohort of 90,476 premenopausal women for 22 years and found that those who ate the most fruit during adolescence (about 3 servings a day) compared with those who ate the lowest intakes (0.5 servings a day) had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer. There was a significant reduction in breast cancer in women who had eaten higher intakes of apples, bananas, grapes, and corn during adolescence, and oranges and kale during early adulthood. No protection was found from drinking fruit juices at younger ages.",
        "a52c9395-2acc-4a44-87b2-22ce5fc06a77": "[3]\nA meta-analysis of cohort studies found that a higher fruit and vegetable intake did not decrease the risk of deaths from cancer. [2]\n\nA more likely possibility is that some types of fruits and vegetables may protect against certain cancers.\n\nA study by Farvid and colleagues followed a Nurses\u2019 Health Study II cohort of 90,476 premenopausal women for 22 years and found that those who ate the most fruit during adolescence (about 3 servings a day) compared with those who ate the lowest intakes (0.5 servings a day) had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer. There was a significant reduction in breast cancer in women who had eaten higher intakes of apples, bananas, grapes, and corn during adolescence, and oranges and kale during early adulthood. No protection was found from drinking fruit juices at younger ages. [9]\nFarvid and colleagues followed 90, 534 premenopausal women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II over 20 years and found that higher fiber intakes during adolescence and early adulthood were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer later in life. When comparing the highest and lowest fiber intakes from fruits and vegetables, women with the highest fruit fiber intake had a 12% reduced risk of breast cancer; those with the highest vegetable fiber intake had an 11% reduced risk. [10]\nAfter following 182,145 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study I and II for 30 years, Farvid\u2019s team also found that women who ate more than 5.5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day (especially cruciferous and yellow/orange vegetables) had an 11% lower risk of breast cancer than those who ate 2.5 or fewer servings. Vegetable intake was strongly associated with a 15% lower risk of estrogen-receptor-negative tumors for every two additional servings of vegetables eaten daily. A higher intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of other aggressive tumors including HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors. [11]\nA report by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research suggests that non-starchy vegetables\u2014such as lettuce and other leafy greens, broccoli, bok choy, cabbage, as well as garlic, onions, and the like\u2014and fruits \u201cprobably\u201d protect against several types of cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, and stomach. Fruit probably also protects against lung cancer. [12]\n\nSpecific components of fruits and vegetables may also be protective against cancer. For example:\n\nA line of research stemming from a finding from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study suggests that tomatoes may help protect men against prostate cancer, especially aggressive forms of it. [12] One of the pigments that give tomatoes their red hue\u2014lycopene\u2014could be involved in this protective effect. Although several studies other than the Health Professionals Study have also demonstrated a link between tomatoes or lycopene and prostate cancer, others have not or have found only a weak connection. [14]\nTaken as a whole, however, these studies suggest that increased consumption of tomato-based products (especially cooked tomato products) and other lycopene-containing foods may reduce the occurrence of prostate cancer. [12] Lycopene is one of several carotenoids (compounds that the body can turn into vitamin A) found in brightly colored fruits and vegetables, and research suggests that foods containing carotenoids may protect against lung, mouth, and throat cancer. [12] But more research is needed to understand the exact relationship between fruits and vegetables, carotenoids, and cancer.\n\nDiabetes\nSome research looks specifically at whether individual fruits are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. While there isn\u2019t an abundance of research into this area yet, preliminary results are compelling.\n\nA study of over 66,000 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, 85,104 women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, and 36,173 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study\u2014who were free of major chronic diseases\u2014found that greater consumption of whole fruits\u2014especially blueberries, grapes, and apples\u2014was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Another important finding was that greater consumption of fruit juice was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.

Another important finding was that greater consumption of fruit juice was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. [15]\nAdditionally a study of over 70,000 female nurses aged 38-63 years, who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, showed that consumption of green leafy vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower risk of diabetes. While not conclusive, research also indicated that consumption of fruit juices may be associated with an increased risk among women. (16)\nA study of over 2,300 Finnish men showed that vegetables and fruits, especially berries, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. [17]\n\nWeight\nData from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies and the Health Professional\u2019s Follow-up Study show that women and men who increased their intakes of fruits and vegetables over a 24-year period were more likely to have lost weight than those who ate the same amount or those who decreased their intake. Berries, apples, pears, soy, and cauliflower were associated with weight loss while starchier vegetables like potatoes, corn, and peas were linked with weight gain. [1] However, keep in mind that adding more produce into the diet won\u2019t necessarily help with weight loss unless it replaces another food, such as refined carbohydrates of white bread and crackers.\nGastrointestinal health\nFruits and vegetables contain indigestible fiber, which absorbs water and expands as it passes through the digestive system. This can calm symptoms of an irritable bowel and, by triggering regular bowel movements, can relieve or prevent constipation. [18] The bulking and softening action of insoluble fiber also decreases pressure inside the intestinal tract and may help prevent diverticulosis. [19]\nVision\nEating fruits and vegetables can also keep your eyes healthy, and may help prevent two common aging-related eye diseases\u2014cataracts and macular degeneration\u2014which afflict millions of Americans over age 65. [20-23] Lutein and zeaxanthin, in particular, seem to reduce risk of cataracts. [24]\nReferences\n\nBertoia ML, Mukamal KJ, Cahill LE, Hou T, Ludwig DS, Mozaffarian D, Willett WC, Hu FB, Rimm EB.

Contrary to past dietary advice promoting low-fat diets, newer research shows that healthy fats are necessary and beneficial for health.\n\nWhen food manufacturers reduce fat, they often replace it with carbohydrates from sugar, refined grains, or other starches. Our bodies digest these refined carbohydrates and starches very quickly, affecting blood sugar and insulin levels and possibly resulting in weight gain and disease. (1-3)\n\n\nFindings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (4) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (5) show that no link between the overall percentage of calories from fat and any important health outcome, including cancer, heart disease, and weight gain.\n\nRather than adopting a low-fat diet, it\u2019s more important to focus on eating beneficial \u201cgood\u201d fats and avoiding harmful \u201cbad\u201d fats. Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. Choose foods with \u201cgood\u201d unsaturated fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid \u201cbad\u201d trans fat.\n\n\u201cGood\u201d unsaturated fats \u2014 Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats \u2014 lower disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish.\n\n\n\u201cBad\u201d fats \u2014 trans fats \u2014 increase disease risk, even when eaten in small quantities. Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Fortunately, trans fats have been eliminated from many of these foods.\n\n\nSaturated fats, while not as harmful as trans fats, by comparison with unsaturated fats negatively impact health and are best consumed in moderation. Foods containing large amounts of saturated fat include red meat, butter, cheese, and ice cream.\u00a0Some plant-based fats like coconut oil and palm oil are also rich in saturated fat.",

Unsaturated fats are predominantly found in foods from plants, such as vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds.\nThere are two types of \u201cgood\u201d unsaturated fats:\n1. Monounsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in:\n\n\n\nOlive, peanut, and canola oils\nAvocados\nNuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, and pecans\nSeeds such as pumpkin and sesame seeds\n\n\n\n2. Polyunsaturated fats are found in high concentrations in\n\n\n\nSunflower, corn, soybean, and flaxseed oils\nWalnuts\nFlax seeds\nFish\nCanola oil \u2013 though higher in monounsaturated fat, it\u2019s also a good source of polyunsaturated fat.\n\n\n\nOmega-3 fats are an important\u00a0 type of polyunsaturated fat. The body can\u2019t make these, so they must come from food.\n\nAn excellent way to get omega-3 fats is by eating fish 2-3 times a week.\n\n\nGood plant sources of omega-3 fats include flax seeds, walnuts, and canola or soybean oil.\n\n\nHigher blood omega-3 fats are associated with lower risk of premature death among older adults, according to a study by HSPH faculty.\n\n\nRead more about omega-3 fats in our Ask the Expert with Dr. Frank Sacks.\n\nMost people don\u2019t eat enough healthful unsaturated fats. The American Heart Association suggests that 8-10 percent of daily calories should come from polyunsaturated fats, and there is evidence that eating more polyunsaturated fat\u2014up to 15 percent of daily calories\u2014in place of saturated fat can lower heart disease risk. (7)\n\nDutch researchers conducted an analysis of 60 trials that examined the effects of carbohydrates and various fats on blood lipid levels. In trials in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats were eaten in place of carbohydrates, these good fats decreased levels of harmful LDL and increased protective HDL. (8)",

(7)\n\nDutch researchers conducted an analysis of 60 trials that examined the effects of carbohydrates and various fats on blood lipid levels. In trials in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats were eaten in place of carbohydrates, these good fats decreased levels of harmful LDL and increased protective HDL. (8)\n\n\nMore recently, a randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart) showed that replacing a carbohydrate-rich diet with one rich in unsaturated fat, predominantly monounsaturated fats, lowers blood pressure, improves lipid levels, and reduces the estimated cardiovascular risk. (9)\n\nFinding Foods with Healthy Fats\u00a0 is a handy visual guide to help you determine which fats are beneficial, and which are harmful.\nSaturated Fats\nAll foods containing fat have a mix of specific types of fats. Even healthy foods like chicken and nuts have small amounts of saturated fat, though much less than the amounts found in beef, cheese, and ice cream. Saturated fat is mainly found in animal foods, but a few plant foods are also high in saturated fats, such as coconut, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends getting less than 10 percent of calories each day from saturated fat. (10)\nThe American Heart Association goes even further, recommending limiting saturated fat to no more than 7 percent of calories. (11)\nCutting back on saturated fat will likely have no benefit, however, if people replace saturated fat with refined carbohydrates. Eating refined carbohydrates in place of saturated fat does lower \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, but it also lowers the \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol and increases triglycerides. The net effect is as bad for the heart as eating too much saturated fat.\n\nIn the United States, the biggest sources of saturated fat (12) in the diet are\n\nPizza and cheese\nWhole and reduced fat milk, butter and dairy desserts\nMeat products (sausage, bacon, beef, hamburgers)\nCookies and other grain-based desserts\nA variety of mixed fast food dishes\n\nThough decades of dietary advice (13, 14) suggested saturated fat was harmful, in recent years that idea has begun to evolve. Several studies suggest that eating diets high in saturated fat do not raise the risk of heart disease, with one report analyzing the findings of 21 studies that followed 350,000 people for up to 23 years.\n\nInvestigators looked at the relationship between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Their controversial conclusion: \u201cThere is insufficient evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD.\u201d(13)\n\n\nA well-publicized 2014 study questioned the link between saturated fat and heart disease, but HSPH nutrition experts determined the paper to be seriously misleading. In order to set the record straight, Harvard School of Public Health convened a panel of nutrition experts and held a teach-in, \u201cSaturated or not: Does type of fat matter?\u201c\n\nThe overarching message is that cutting back on saturated fat can be good for health if people replace saturated fat with good fats, especially, polyunsaturated fats. (1, 15, 22) Eating good fats in place of saturated fat lowers the \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol, and it improves the ratio of total cholesterol to \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of heart disease.\nEating good fats in place of saturated fat can also help prevent insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. (16) So while saturated fat may not be as harmful as once thought, evidence clearly shows that unsaturated fat remains the healthiest type of fat.\n\n\nPercentage of Specific Types of Fat in Common Oils and Fats*\n\n\n\nOils\n\nSaturated\n\n\nMonounsaturated\n\n\nPolyunsaturated\n\n\nTrans\n\n\n\nCanola\n\n7\n\n\n58\n\n\n29\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nSafflower\n\n9\n\n\n12\n\n\n74\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nSunflower\n\n10\n\n\n20\n\n\n66\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nCorn\n\n13\n\n\n24\n\n\n60\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nOlive\n\n13\n\n\n72\n\n\n8\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nSoybean\n\n16\n\n\n44\n\n\n37\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nPeanut\n\n17\n\n\n49\n\n\n32\n\n\n0\n\n\n\nPalm\n\n50\n\n\n37\n\n\n10",

This process also converts the oil into a solid, which makes them function as margarine or shortening.\n\n\nPartially hydrogenated oils can withstand repeated heating without breaking down, making them ideal for frying fast foods.\n\n\nFor these reasons, partially hydrogenated oils became a mainstay in restaurants and the food industry \u2013 for frying, baked goods, and processed snack foods and margarine.\n\nPartially hydrogenated oil is not the only source of trans fats in our diets. Trans fats are also naturally found in beef fat and dairy fat in small amounts.\nTrans fats are the\u00a0worst type of fat\u00a0for the heart, blood vessels, and rest of the body because they:\n\nRaise bad LDL and lower good HDL\n\n\nCreate inflammation, (18) \u2013 a reaction related to immunity \u2013 which has been implicated in heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic conditions\n\n\nContribute to insulin resistance (16)",

This phantom fat was found in thousands of foods, but only those familiar with the \u201ccode words\u201d\u00a0partially hydrogenated oil\u00a0and\u00a0vegetable shortening\u00a0knew when it was present. Fortunately, after a large body of research in the 1990s sounded the alarm on its deleterious health effects, a series of policy initiatives led to the near elimination of artificial trans fat in the U.S. food supply by 2018. However, the road to eliminating trans fat was not so straightforward, and outside the U.S. there\u2019s still more work to be done. In many developing nations, trans fat intake remains high.Read more about the key research and policy initiatives shining the spotlight on harmful trans fats. \nReferences\n\n7. Mozaffarian, D., R.

Instead, the body packages fat and cholesterol into tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins can transport a lot of fat; they mix easily with blood and flow with it. Some of these particles are big and fluffy, while others are small and dense. The most important ones are low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL) , and triglycerides.\n\nLow Density lipoproteins\n\nLow-density lipoproteins (LDL) carry cholesterol from the liver to the rest of the body. Cells latch onto these particles and extract fat and cholesterol from them. When there is too much LDL cholesterol in the blood, these particles can form deposits in the walls of the coronary arteries and other arteries throughout the body. Such deposits, called plaque, can narrow arteries and limit blood flow. When plaque breaks apart, it can cause a heart attack or stroke. Because of this, LDL cholesterol is often referred to as bad, or harmful, cholesterol.\n\nHigh-density lipoproteins\n\nHigh-density lipoproteins (HDL) scavenge cholesterol from the bloodstream, from LDL, and from artery walls and ferry it back to the liver for disposal. Think of HDL as the garbage trucks of the bloodstream. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as good, or protective, cholesterol.\n\nTriglycerides\n\nTriglycerides make up most of the fat that you eat and that travels through the bloodstream. As the body\u2019s main vehicle for transporting fats to cells, triglycerides are important for good health, though high levels of triglycerides can be unhealthy.\nIn general, the lower your LDL and the higher your HDL, the better your chances of preventing heart disease and other chronic conditions.\nHow Fat and Cholesterol in Food Affect Blood Cholesterol Levels\nThe types of fat in the diet help determine the amount of total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. The types and amount of carbohydrate in the diet also play a role. Cholesterol in food matters, too, but not nearly as much.\n\nThe discovery half a century ago that high blood cholesterol levels were strongly associated with an increased risk for heart disease triggered numerous warnings to avoid foods that contain cholesterol, especially eggs and liver. However, scientific studies show a weak relationship between the amount of cholesterol a person consumes and his or her blood cholesterol levels (22)",
        "9e237ab6-1ece-4cee-8da4-9388937fe28c": "In studies of more than 80,000 female nurses, Harvard researchers found that consuming about an egg a day was not associated with higher risk of heart disease. (4, 23) However, people who have heart disease or diabetes should monitor egg consumption.\n\nFor most people, the amount of cholesterol eaten has only a modest impact on the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood. (24) For some people, though, blood cholesterol levels rise and fall very strongly in relation to the amount of cholesterol eaten. For these \u201cresponders,\u201d avoiding cholesterol-rich foods can have a substantial effect on blood cholesterol levels. Unfortunately, at this point there is no way other than by trial and error to identify responders from non-responders to dietary cholesterol.\nReferences\n\n4.

(6, 17)\n\n\nIf you already have diabetes, eating fish can help protect you against a heart attack or dying from heart disease. (25) Eating omega-3 fats from fish does not protect against diabetes, even though there is much evidence that these marine omega-3 fats help prevent fatal heart disease. (26)\n\nHeart Disease\nIn a randomized controlled trial (27) a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, both rich sources of unsaturated fat, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with diabetes or other risk factors over a 4.8-year follow-up.\n\nThis study highlighted that low-fat diets are continuing to lose credibility, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 can improve heart health.\n\n\nThere isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes can incorporate the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern including:\n\n\u2013 High intake of olive oil, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and mainly whole grain cereals\n\u2013 Moderate intake of fish and poultry\n\u2013 Low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets\n\u2013 Wine in moderation, consumed with meals\nCancer\nResearchers once suspected an association between dietary fat and common cancers. However, in adults, the percentage of calories consumed from total fat appears to have no significant association with cancer risk, and there is currently no clear evidence linking any specific type of fat with cancer incidence.\nBreast Cancer\nIn the early 1980s, most nutrition experts believed that dietary fat was a major cause of breast cancer. (28, 29) This thinking was largely based on international comparisons showing higher breast cancer rates in countries with higher per capita fat intake. But as more prospective studies and randomized controlled trials were performed over the next couple of decades, the apparent link between total fat intake and breast cancer has faded. (30)\n\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, which was specifically designed to examine the effect of a low-fat diet on the development of breast cancer, showed similar rates of breast cancer in women eating a low-fat diet and in those eating a \u201cregular\u201d diet. (31)",
        "57afd249-5e8d-4074-9e94-5af7c17ad596": "One study from the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP Diet and Health Study found a very weak positive association between fat and postmenopausal breast cancer, (32) but when combined with the many other studies detailed above, the overall evidence does not support a relationship between total fat intake and breast cancer. In a recent study, saturated fat was weakly associated with one form of breast cancer, but this could have been due to differences in physical activity and needs confirmation. (citation below)\n\n\nAlthough studies of different types of fat have largely failed to find a link with breast cancer, some evidence suggests that animal fat intake in young women may be linked to higher risk of breast cancer. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, premenopausal women who ate diets high in animal fat had a 40 to 50 percent higher risk of breast cancer, compared to women who ate the least animal fat. (33) Because vegetable fat was not related to risk of breast cancer, these findings suggest that red meat and high-fat dairy products may contain other factors, such as hormones, that increase risk of breast cancer.\n\n\nSome European studies have reported suggestive findings of lower breast cancer risk among women with a high intake of monounsaturated fats (mainly in the form of olive oil). (34, 35)\n\nColon Cancer\nAs with breast cancer, international comparisons initially suggested an association between total dietary fat intake and colon cancer risk. But later and better studies contradicted these earlier findings and revealed no significant association.\n\nWomen in the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial who ate a low-fat diet developed colon cancer at the same rate as women who didn\u2019t. (36)\n\n\nAlthough fat intake doesn\u2019t seem to increase colon cancer risk, there is strong evidence that high consumption of red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and especially processed meat (hot dogs, bacon, and deli meats) does increase colon cancer risk. (37) Based on this evidence and other studies related to heart disease and diabetes, it\u2019s best to limit red meat consumption to no more than twice a week, and to avoid processed meats.\n\nProstate Cancer\nAlthough the exact connection between dietary fat and prostate cancer is unclear, there is some evidence that diets high in animal fat and saturated fat may increase prostate cancer risk. However, other studies have shown no association, while others have implicated unsaturated fats. More research is needed to elucidate any possible links between dietary fat and prostate cancer.\nOther Cancers\nPreliminary research has also linked the intake of certain kinds of fat with other cancers, though more research is needed to confirm these results. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, Harvard researchers found that a high intake of trans fats was associated with risk for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. (38)\nOther Chronic Conditions\nThere is a small but growing body of work on the effects of dietary fats on conditions such as depression, (39) osteoporosis, (40) age-related memory loss, (41) cognitive decline, (42) macular degeneration, (43) multiple sclerosis, (44) infertility and endometriosis, (45, 46) and other chronic conditions. The preliminary findings do not offer sufficient evidence to suggest modifying dietary fat recommendations.\nReferences\n\n6. Hu, F.B., J.E. Manson, and W.C.

However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat.\nVitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K) dissolve in fat and tend to accumulate in the body. Water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate) must dissolve in water before they can be absorbed by the body, and therefore cannot be stored. Any water-soluble vitamins unused by the body is primarily lost through urine.\nMinerals are inorganic elements present in soil and water, which are absorbed by plants or consumed by animals. While you\u2019re likely familiar with calcium, sodium, and potassium, there is a range of other minerals, including trace minerals (e.g. copper, iodine, and zinc) needed in very small amounts.\nIn the U.S., the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) develops nutrient reference values called the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins and minerals. [1] These are intended as a guide for good nutrition and as a scientific basis for the development of food guidelines in both the U.S. and Canada. The DRIs are specific to age, gender, and life stages, and cover more than 40 nutrient substances. The guidelines are based on available reports of deficiency and toxicity of each nutrient.

An AI is a recommended intake when an RDA can\u2019t be determined. RDA is the average daily dietary intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of 97-98% of healthy individuals in a particular group according to stage of life and gender.\n** May play a role in the human body, but adequate research regarding its nutritional importance is not available so RDA or AI has not been set.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about multivitamins?\nA diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, good protein packages, and healthful fats should provide most of the nutrients needed for good health. But not everyone manages to eat a healthful diet. Multivitamins can play an important role when nutritional requirements are not met through diet alone. Learn more about vitamin supplementation.\nDid you know?\u00a0\nVitamins and their precise requirements have been controversial since their discovery in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It was the combined efforts of epidemiologists, physicians, chemists, and physiologists that led to our modern day understanding of vitamins and minerals. After years of observation, experiments, and trial and error, they were able to distinguish that some diseases were not caused by infections or toxins\u2014a common belief at the time\u2014but by vitamin deficiencies. [2] Chemists worked to identify a vitamin\u2019s chemical structure so it could be replicated. Soon after, researchers determined specific amounts of vitamins needed to avoid diseases of deficiency.\nIn 1912, biochemist Casimir Funk was the first to coin the term \u201cvitamin\u201d in a research publication that was accepted by the medical community, derived from \u201cvita\u201d meaning life, and \u201camine\u201d referring to a nitrogenous substance essential for life. [3] Funk is considered the father of vitamin therapy, as he identified nutritional components that were missing in diseases of deficiency like scurvy (too little vitamin C), beri-beri (too little vitamin B1), pellagra (too little vitamin B3), and rickets (too little vitamin D). The discovery of all vitamins occurred by 1948.\nVitamins were obtained only from food until the 1930s when commercially made supplements of certain vitamins became available. The U.S government also began fortifying foods with specific nutrients to prevent deficiencies common at the time, such as adding iodine to salt to prevent goiter, and adding folic acid to grain products to reduce birth defects during pregnancy. In the 1950s, most vitamins and multivitamins were available for sale to the general public to prevent deficiencies, some receiving a good amount of marketing in popular magazines such as promoting cod liver oil containing vitamin D as bottled sunshine.",

Humans relied on it as the only beverage for millions of years. Milk was introduced with the advent of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Then came beer and wine and coffee and tea, all consumed for taste and pleasure as much as for the fluids they provide. The newcomers\u2014sugary beverages including soda, sports drinks, and energy drinks\u2014offer hydration but with a hefty dose of unnecessary calories that the body may have a hard time regulating. Alternatively, \u201cdiet\u201d drinks offer sweetness without the calories, but does that make them a healthy choice?\nWith so many options, it\u2019s easy to be confused about which beverages are best for our health. Follow the links below for an in-depth look at each, but if you\u2019re short on time, here\u2019s the takeaway:\n\nWater is the best choice for quenching your thirst. Coffee and tea, without added sweeteners, are healthy choices, too.\nSome beverages should be limited or consumed in moderation, including fruit juice, milk, and those made with low-calorie sweeteners, like diet drinks. Alcohol in moderation can be healthy for some people, but not everyone.\nIt\u2019s generally best to avoid sugary drinks like soda, sports beverages, and energy drinks.\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

They are brimming with antioxidants, flavonoids, and other biologically active substances that may be good for health.\nCoffee\nThe takeaway on coffee:A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies\u00a0to improve your health.\u00a0Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee.\u00a0It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\nLearn more about the research behind coffee and health\nTea\n\nThe takeaway on tea:Tea is the simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis\u00a0plant. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. Herbal teas are not made from the\u00a0Camellia\u00a0plant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas.\nAnimal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. [2] However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (130-140\u00b0 F). [2,3] Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea. So pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!\nLearn more about the research behind tea and health\n\u00a0\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Because sweet \u201cdiet\u201d drinks may condition you to crave other sweet drinks and foods, drinking \u201cdiet\u201d drinks has the possibility of leading to weight gain.\n\n\nMoreover, the other health effects of artificially sweetened diet drinks remains largely unknown. It\u2019s best to limit them if you drink them at all, and for a refreshing drink with flavor try adding a squeeze of lemon juice to plain water.\n\nLearn more about artificial sweeteners.\n100% fruit juice\nFruit juice has vitamins, but it is high in calories from concentrated fruit sugars, so stick to no more than a small glass (four to six ounces) a day. If you\u2019re in the mood for fruit, enjoy a whole piece of fruit which is much lower in sugars than its juice equivalent and contains the added benefit of fiber.\nMilk\nThere\u2019s no need to drink more than a glass or two of low fat or skim milk a day. Less milk is fine if you get your calcium from other sources. For children, milk is a key source of calcium and vitamin D, protein and other essential micronutrients. The ideal amount of milk and calcium isn\u2019t exactly clear, but no more than two glasses per day appears to provide sufficient nutrition without being excessive.\nLearn more about milk and other dairy products.\nAlcohol\n\nModerate drinking can be healthy\u2014but not for everyone. You must weigh the benefits and risks; that\u2019s why it\u2019s not included on the Healthy Eating Plate.\n\n\nNon-drinkers shouldn\u2019t feel that they need to start drinking.\n\nIsn\u2019t alcohol supposed to be good for you in small amounts?\nFor some people, alcohol consumption can offer health benefits, whereas for others alcohol may pose risks.\u00a0Learn more about the risks and benefits of alcohol.\nDo some types of alcohol offer greater benefits than others?\nSome studies have suggested that red wine\u2014particularly when consumed with a meal\u2014offers more cardiovascular benefits than beer or spirits. Despite the healthful compounds identified in red wine, epidemiological studies have not confirmed that a specific type of alcoholic drink, whether wine, beer, or spirits, reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

This includes soda, pop, cola, tonic, fruit punch, lemonade (and other \u201cades\u201d), sweetened powdered drinks, as well as sports and energy drinks.\nAs a category, these beverages are the single largest source of calories and added sugar in the U.S. diet. [1,2] In other parts of the world, particularly developing countries, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3]\nHow sweet is it?There are 4.2 grams of sugar in a single teaspoon. Now, imagine scooping up 7 to 10 teaspoons full of sugar and dumping it into your 12-ounce glass of water. Does that sound too sweet? You may be surprised to learn that\u2019s how much added sugar is in the typical can of soda. This can be a useful tip to visualize just how much sugar is in your drink. To get you started, we\u2019ve prepared a handy guide to the amount of sugar and calories in popular beverages.\nAside from soda, energy drinks have as much sugar as soft drinks, enough caffeine to raise your blood pressure, and additives whose long-term health effects are unknown. For these reasons, it\u2019s best to skip energy drinks. The guide includes sports beverages as well. Although designed to give athletes carbohydrates, electrolytes, and fluid during high-intensity workouts that last one hour or more, for everyone else they\u2019re just another source of calories and sugar.\nDrinks naturally high in sugar like 100% fruit juices are also featured. While juice often contains healthful nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, it should also be limited as it contains just as much sugar (though from naturally occurring fruit sugars) and calories as soft drinks.\n\nSugary drinks and health\nWhen it comes to ranking beverages best for our health, sugary drinks fall at the bottom of the list because they provide so many calories and virtually no other nutrients. People who drink sugary beverages do not feel as full as if they had eaten the same calories from solid food, and research indicates they also don\u2019t compensate for the high caloric content of these beverages by eating less food. [4] The average can of sugar-sweetened soda or fruit punch provides about 150 calories, almost all of them from added sugar. If you were to drink just one of these sugary drinks every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 5 pounds in a year. Beyond weight gain, routinely drinking these sugar-loaded beverages can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic diseases. Furthermore, higher consumption of sugary beverages has been linked with an increased risk of premature death. [5]",
        "6cabe8fd-bee4-4fb4-9251-389ed48988ac": "Body weight and obesity\nThe more ounces of sugary beverages a person has each day, the more calories he or she takes in later in the day. This is the opposite of what happens with solid food, as people tend to compensate for a large meal by taking in fewer calories at a later meal. This compensatory effect doesn\u2019t seem to be present after consuming soft drinks, for several possible reasons:\n\nFluids don\u2019t provide the same feeling of fullness or satisfaction as solid foods, as the body doesn\u2019t \u201cregister\u201d liquid calories as it does calories from solid food. This may prompt a person to keep eating even after intake of a high-calorie drink.\nIt is possible that sweet-tasting soft drinks\u2014regardless of whether they are sweetened with sugar or a calorie-free sugar substitute\u2014might stimulate the appetite for other sweet, high-carbohydrate foods.\nEven though soda may contain more sugar than a cookie, because people think of soda as a drink and a cookie as a dessert they are more likely to limit food than beverages.\n\nDozens of studies have explored possible links between soft drinks and weight, and they consistently show that increased consumption of soft drinks is associated with increased energy (caloric) intake.\n\nOne meta-analysis of 88 studies showed that the effect appeared to be stronger in women. [6]\nStudies in children and adults have found that reducing sugary drink consumption can lead to better weight control among those who are initially overweight. [7,8]\nAn 18-month trial involving 641 primarily normal-weight children randomly assigned to receive either a sugar-free, artificially sweetened beverage (sugar-free group) or a similar sugar-containing beverage (sugar group) found that replacement of sugar-containing beverages with noncaloric beverages reduced weight gain and fat accumulation in the normal-weight children. [9]\nOther studies have found a significant link between sugary drink consumption and weight gain in children. [10] One study found that for each additional 12-ounce soda children consumed each day, the odds of having obesity increased by 60% during 1\u00bd years of follow-up. [11]\nA 20-year study on 120,000 men and women found that people who increased their sugary drink consumption by one 12-ounce serving per day gained more weight over time\u2014on average, an extra pound every 4 years\u2014than people who did not change their intake. [12]\nAn updated meta-analysis looking at the association of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and weight trends in adults and children was published as a follow-up to a 2013 meta-analysis from the same authors. [13] This review of 85 prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials published from 2013 to 2022 included more than 500,000 participants, and again confirmed a strong connection between higher intakes of SSBs and weight gain in both age groups. [14] They also found that a reduced intake of SSBs resulted in weight loss.\nA groundbreaking study of 33,097 individuals showed that among people with a genetic predisposition for obesity, those who drank sugary drinks were more likely to have obesity than those who did not. [15] This study is important because it suggests that genetic risk for obesity does not need to become a reality if healthy habits, like avoiding sugary drinks, are followed. On the other hand, genetic obesity risk seems to be amplified by consuming sugary drinks. Read an interview with the study\u2019s lead researcher.\n\nAlternatively, drinking water in place of sugary drinks or fruit juices is associated with lower long-term weight gain. [16]",
        "067289dc-901c-4bfb-8cfc-9f25b91ddb12": "Diabetes\nPeople who consume sugary drinks regularly\u20141 to 2 cans a day or more\u2014have a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than people who rarely have such drinks. [17] Risks are even greater in young adults and Asians.\nStrong evidence indicates that sugar-sweetened soft drinks contribute to the development of diabetes.\n\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study explored this connection by following the health of more than 90,000 women for eight years. The nurses who said they had one or more servings a day of a sugar-sweetened soft drink or fruit punch were twice as likely to have developed type 2 diabetes during the study than those who rarely had these beverages. [18]\n\nA similar increase in risk of diabetes with increasing soft drink and fruit drink consumption was seen recently in the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, an ongoing long-term study of nearly 60,000 African-American women from all parts of the United States. [19] Interestingly, the increased risk with soft drinks was tightly linked to increased weight.\nIn the Framingham Heart Study, men and women who had one or more soft drinks a day were 25 percent more likely to have developed trouble managing blood sugar and nearly 50 percent more likely to have developed metabolic syndrome. [20]\nA 2019 study looking at 22\u201326 years\u2019 worth of data from more than 192,000 men and women participating in three long-term studies (the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, and the Health Professionals\u2019 Follow-up Study) found that increasing total sugary beverage intake\u2014including both sugar sweetened beverages and 100% fruit juice\u2014by more than 4 ounces per day over a four-year period was associated with a 16% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in the following four years. [21]\n\nIncreasing consumption of artificially sweetened beverages by more than 4 ounces per day over four years was linked with 18% higher diabetes risk, but the authors note these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the possibility of reverse causation (individuals already at high risk for diabetes may switch from sugary beverages to diet drinks) and surveillance bias (high-risk individuals are more likely to be screened for diabetes and thus diagnosed more rapidly).\nThe study also found that drinking more artificially sweetened beverages in place of sugary beverages did not appear to lessen diabetes risk. However, replacing one daily serving of a sugary beverage with water, coffee, or tea was linked with a 2\u201310% lower risk of diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart disease\n\nA study that followed 40,000 men for two decades found that those who averaged one can of a sugary beverage per day had a 20% higher risk of having a heart attack or dying from a heart attack than men who rarely consumed sugary drinks. [22]\nA related study in women found a similar sugary beverage\u2013heart disease link. The Nurses\u2019 Health Study, which tracked the health of nearly 90,000 women over two decades, found that women who drank more than two servings of sugary beverage each day had a 40 percent higher risk of heart attacks or death from heart disease than women who rarely drank sugary beverages. [23]\n\nPeople who drink a lot of sugary drinks often tend to weigh more\u2014and eat less healthfully\u2014than people who don\u2019t drink sugary drinks, and the volunteers in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study were no exception. But researchers accounted for differences in diet quality, energy intake, and weight among the study volunteers. They found that having an otherwise healthy diet, or being at a healthy weight, only slightly diminished the risk associated with drinking sugary beverages.\nThis suggests that weighing too much, or simply eating too many calories, may only partly explain the relationship between sugary drinks and heart disease. Some risk may also be attributed to the metabolic effects of fructose from the sugar or HFCS used to sweeten these beverages.\nThe adverse effects of the high glycemic load from these beverages on blood glucose, cholesterol fractions, and inflammatory factors probably also contribute to the higher risk of heart disease. \u00a0Read more about\u00a0blood sugar and glycemic load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGout\nA 22-year-long study of 80,000 women found that those who consumed a can a day of sugary drink had a 75% higher risk of gout than women who rarely had such drinks. [24] Researchers found a similarly-elevated risk in men. [25]",

[24] Researchers found a similarly-elevated risk in men. [25]\n\n\n\n\nBone health\nSoda may pose a unique challenge to healthy bones:\n\nSoda contains high levels of phosphate.\nConsuming more phosphate than calcium can have a deleterious effect on bone health. [26]\nGetting enough\u00a0calcium is extremely important during childhood and adolescence, when bones are being built.\nSoft drinks are generally devoid of calcium and other healthful nutrients, yet they are actively marketed to young age groups.\nMilk is a good source of calcium and protein, and also provides vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and other micronutrients.\n\nThere is an inverse pattern between soft drink consumption and milk consumption \u2013 when one goes up, the other goes down. [6]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiver cancer\nResults from a Women\u2019s Health Initiative study following 98,786 postmenopausal women (ages aged 50 to 79) for about 20 years found that participants who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) had an increased risk of liver cancer. More specifically, those drinking 1 or more servings of SSB daily had an 85% higher risk of liver cancer than those who drank 3 or fewer servings of SSB per month. The participants used questionnaires to self-report their intakes of SSB (including soda and fruit drinks but not fruit juice) and diagnosis of liver cancer. The researchers also examined intakes of artificially sweetened beverages, comparing higher intakes of 1 or more servings per day with lower intakes of 3 or fewer servings per month, but did not find any association with liver cancer. [27]",
        "413b4f1b-5195-478c-b0be-07cc1a4081e3": "Liver cancer\nResults from a Women\u2019s Health Initiative study following 98,786 postmenopausal women (ages aged 50 to 79) for about 20 years found that participants who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) had an increased risk of liver cancer.

The researchers also examined intakes of artificially sweetened beverages, comparing higher intakes of 1 or more servings per day with lower intakes of 3 or fewer servings per month, but did not find any association with liver cancer. [27]\n\n\n\n\nMortality\nAccording to a large, long-term study of 37,716 men and 80,647 women in the U.S., the more sugary beverages people drink, the greater their risk of premature death \u2014 particularly from cardiovascular disease, and to a lesser extent from cancer. [5]\n\nAfter adjusting for major diet and lifestyle factors, the researchers found that the more sugary beverages a person drank, the more their risk of early death from any cause increased. Compared with drinking sugary beverages less than once per month, drinking one to four per month was linked with a 1% increased risk; two to six per week with a 6% increase; one to two per day with a 14% increase; and two or more per day with a 21% increase. The increased early death risk linked with sugary drink consumption was more apparent among women than among men.\nThere was a particularly strong link between drinking sugary beverages and increased risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. Compared with infrequent drinkers, those who drank two or more servings per day had a 31% higher risk of early death from cardiovascular disease. Each additional serving per day of sugary drink was linked with a 10% increased higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death.\nAmong both men and women, there was a modest link between consumption and early death risk from cancer.\nThe study also found that drinking one artificially sweetened beverage per day instead of a sugary one lowered the risk of premature death. However, drinking four or more artificially sweetened beverages per day was associated with increased risk of mortality in women, so researchers cautioned against excessive consumption of artificially-sweetened beverages.\n\nAnother long-term study of 18 years from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study also found that sugary beverages were linked with a higher risk of premature death in more than 15,000 men and women with type 2 diabetes. [28] It found an increased risk of early death from any cause as well as a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature deaths from CVD. Replacing sugary beverages with artificially sweetened beverages was associated with a significantly lower risk of CVD incidence and early death in adults with diabetes, even after controlling for weight changes.\nResults from a Women\u2019s Health Initiative study following 98,786 postmenopausal women (aged 50 to 79) for about 20 years found that participants who drank the highest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) had an increased risk of death from chronic liver diseases like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and fibrosis. [27] More specifically, those drinking 1 or more servings of SSB daily had a 68% higher risk of death from chronic liver disease than those who drank 3 or fewer servings of SSB a month. The participants used questionnaires to self-report their intakes of SSB (including soda and fruit drinks but not fruit juice) and diagnosis of chronic liver disease. The researchers also examined intakes of artificially sweetened beverages, comparing higher intakes of 1 or more servings per day with lower intakes of 3 or fewer servings per month, but did not find any association with deaths from chronic liver disease.\n\n\nSugary drink supersizing and the obesity epidemic\nThere is sufficient scientific evidence that decreasing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption will reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases. [29] Unfortunately, sugary beverages are a regular drink of choice for millions around the world, and a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.\nCompounding the problem is that sugary drink portion sizes have risen dramatically over the past 40 years, leading to increased consumption among children and adults:\n\nBefore the 1950s, standard soft-drink bottles were 6.5 ounces. In the 1950s, soft-drink makers introduced larger sizes, including the 12-ounce can, which became widely available in 1960.",

In the 1950s, soft-drink makers introduced larger sizes, including the 12-ounce can, which became widely available in 1960. [30] By the early 1990s, 20-ounce plastic bottles became the norm. [31] Today, contour-shaped plastic bottles are available in even larger sizes, such as 1-liter.\nIn the 1970s, sugary drinks made up about 4% of U.S. daily calorie intake; by 2001, that had risen to about 9%. [32]\nChildren and youth in the US averaged 224 calories per day from sugary beverages in 1999 to 2004\u2014nearly 11% of their daily calorie intake. [33] From 1989 to 2008, calories from sugary beverages increased by 60% in children ages 6 to 11, from 130 to 209 calories per day, and the percentage of children consuming them rose from 79% to 91%. [34] In 2005, sugary drinks (soda, energy, sports drinks) were the top calorie source in teens\u2019 diets (226 calories per day), beating out pizza (213 calories per day). [2]\nAlthough consumption of sugary drinks in the U.S. has decreased in the past decade, [35] half of the population consumes sugary drinks on a given day; 1 in 4 people get at least 200 calories from such drinks; and 5% get at least 567 calories\u2014equivalent to four cans of soda. [36] These intake levels exceed dietary recommendations for consuming no more than 10% of total daily calories from added sugar [37]\nGlobally, and in developing countries in particular, sugary drink consumption is rising dramatically due to widespread urbanization and beverage marketing. [3]\n\nThe role of sugary drink marketing\nBeverage companies spend billions of dollars marketing sugary drinks, yet generally rebuffs suggestions that its products and marketing tactics play any role in the obesity epidemic. [38]\n\nIn 2013, Coca-Cola launched an \u201canti-obesity\u201d advertisement recognizing that sweetened soda and many other foods and drinks have contributed to the obesity epidemic. The company advertised its wide array of calorie-free beverages and encouraged individuals to take responsibility for their own drink choices and weight. Responses to the advertisement were mixed, with many experts calling it misleading and inaccurate in stating the health dangers of soda.\n\nAdding to the confusion, studies funded by the beverage industry are four to eight times more likely to show a finding favorable to industry than independently-funded studies. [39]\nIt\u2019s also important to note that a significant portion of sugary drink marketing is typically aimed directly at children and adolescents. [40]\n\nA 2019 analysis by the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that kids ages 2-11 saw twice as many ads for sugary drinks than for other beverages, and they also saw four times as many ads for certain drinks than adults did. [41] Researchers also analyzed nearly 70 \u201cchildren\u2019s drinks\u201d (those marketed to parents and/or directly to children), and found that sweetened drinks contributed 62% of children\u2019s drink sales in 2018, including $1.2 billion in fruit drinks (90% of children\u2019s sweetened drink sales) and $146 million in flavored, sweetened water sales.\n\nCutting back on sugary drinks\nWhen it comes to our health, it\u2019s clear that sugary drinks should be avoided. There is a range of healthier beverages that can be consumed in their place, with water being the top option.\nOf course, if you\u2019re a frequent soda drinker, this is easier said than done. If it\u2019s the carbonation you like, give sparkling water a try. If the taste is too bland, try a naturally flavored sparkling water. If that\u2019s still too much of a jump, add a splash of juice, sliced citrus, or even some fresh herbs. You can do this with home-brewed tea as well, like this sparkling iced tea with lemon, cucumber, and mint.",

These include artificial sweeteners, such as Aspartame and Sucralose, as well as extracts from plants like steviol glycosides and monk fruit. Beverages containing LCS sometimes carry the label \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201cdiet.\u201d The health effects of LCS are inconclusive, with research showing mixed findings. A 2018 scientific advisory by the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association noted that further research on the effects of LCS beverages on weight control, cardiometabolic risk factors, and risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases is needed. That said, they also note that for adults who are regular high consumers of sugary drinks, LCS beverages may be a useful temporary replacement strategy to reduce intake of sugary drinks.\nLearn more about the research on LCS in foods and beverages.\nAction beyond the individual level\nReducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels\u2014from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government. We must work together toward this worthy and urgent cause: alleviating the cost and the burden of chronic diseases associated with the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the U.S. and around the world. Fortunately, sugary drinks are a growing topic in policy discussions both nationally and internationally.

[1] Some brands also contain B vitamins associated with increased energy (not to be confused with energy drinks, which are a different product entirely). Sports drinks contain carbohydrate in the form of sugar (e.g., glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose) or contain no sugar and are flavored instead with low-calorie sweeteners. The specific amount of sugar and electrolytes in sports drinks is intended to allow for quick hydration and absorption.\nThis type of nutrient depletion generally occurs only with high-intensity exercise that lasts an hour or more. For the non-athlete, a sports beverage is just another sugary drink.\nSports Drinks and Health\nResearch has shown benefit of sports drinks in adult athletes (though not conclusive as some studies show no benefit), but research in children is lacking. [2] Children sweat at highly variable rates, so it is more difficult to establish an amount of exercise time that the drinks may be useful. [1] However, with monitoring by coaches or parents, providing these drinks to children and adolescents who are exercising vigorously for more than 60 minutes may help to prevent dehydration. For children who are engaged in routine or play-based physical activity, these drinks are usually unnecessary. [1]\nEstimates show that sports drinks comprise about 26% of total sugar-sweetened beverage intake in adolescents. [2] Sports drinks contain less sugar than soda and energy drinks, but still contain simple sugars. For example, a nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, compared with 21 grams of sugar in a popular sports drinks. Drinking too many of these, especially when not performing vigorous exercise, can increase the risk of overweight/obesity and other health problems such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout. There is also a risk of dental caries.\n\nA study following more than 4,100 females and 3,400 males for 7 years as part of the Growing Up Today Study II found that the more frequently sports beverages were consumed, the greater the association with an increased body mass index leading to overweight/obesity, especially in boys. [2] The authors cited endorsements of the drinks by sports celebrities as a strong influencer in young male athletes. The drinks may also be perceived as healthy because they are allowed to be sold in schools and sporting events, so may be consumed in excess.\n\nBottom Line\nWater that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. A sports drink may be used by people engaging in exercise of vigorous intensity for more than one hour, especially if sweating heavily. Perhaps of greater importance in athletes of any age, but especially youth, is to encourage a balanced diet, snacks as needed, and adequate water that will best enhance physical and mental performance. Pediatricians should discuss the use of sports drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully.

They are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts of caffeine and as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee. Other substances purported to increase energy may be added, like B vitamins and herbs such as ginseng and guarana. Most concerning is a lack of regulation about the safety of these drinks, as well as aggressive marketing tactics geared toward adolescents. [1] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2007, 1,145 adolescents ages 12 to 17 went to the emergency room for an energy drink-related emergency. In 2011 that number climbed to 1,499. [2]\nAfter water, sugar is the main ingredient in energy drinks. A nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, 41 grams of sugar in an energy drink. Research has found that consuming high-sugar drinks of any kind can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout.\nBecause of the amount of sugar and stimulant ingredients, there is concern that these beverages may not be helpful, and even worse, harmful to adolescents and people with certain health conditions.\u00a0\nEnergy Drinks and Health\nSipping a beverage that offers quick energy may appeal to people who feel fatigued or who believe the caffeine can provide an edge when exercising or playing competitive sports. Although statements on the websites of energy drinks warn that these beverages may not be suitable for children, youth are among their largest consumers. An energy drink may be used by adolescents or college students cramming for exams through the night, or by a young athlete before an important game. While it is true that some controlled trials have shown temporary improved alertness and reversal of fatigue after taking energy drinks, as well as enhanced physical performance in young athletes, the majority of studies show an association with negative health effects. These include increased stress, aggressive behaviors like fighting, alcohol/cigarette abuse, increased blood pressure, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, poor sleep quality, and stomach irritation.",

These include increased stress, aggressive behaviors like fighting, alcohol/cigarette abuse, increased blood pressure, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, poor sleep quality, and stomach irritation. [1]\nA typical energy drink may contain the following: carbonated water, around 40 grams of sugar (from sucrose and/or glucose), 160 mg or more of caffeine, artificial sweetener, and herbs/substances associated with mental alertness and performance but that lack scientific evidence with controlled trials (taurine, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartarate, guarana seed extract, B vitamins).\nSpecial concerns with energy drinks:\n\nAmplified negative health effects in adolescents. Children and teens may experience heightened effects from the high amounts of caffeine, added sugars including high fructose corn syrup, low-calorie sweeteners, and herbal stimulants, partly due to their smaller body size. [3]\nMarketing tactics towards youth. Estimates show more than a 240% increase in U.S. and worldwide sales of energy drinks. It is a $21 billion industry, with marketing campaigns targeting youth and being sold in places that are easily accessed by this age group. [1,4] Youth are exposed to energy drink advertising on children\u2019s websites, computer games, television, supermarkets, and sporting events. [5] Research has shown that adolescents lack maturity in key areas of the brain and are more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior, making them vulnerable to risky behaviors sometimes portrayed in energy drink marketing. Youth are attracted to energy drinks due to effective marketing, influence from peers, and lack of knowledge about their potential harmful effects. [4]\nNegative health outcomes. Emerging evidence has linked energy drink consumption with negative health consequences in youth like risk-seeking behaviors, poor mental health, adverse cardiovascular effects, and metabolic, renal, or dental problems. [1]\nExcessive caffeine. Too much caffeine from any beverage, particularly when several are taken in one day in sensitive individuals, can lead to anxiety, insomnia, heart problems like irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure, and in rare cases seizures or cardiac arrest. Some energy drinks may contain as much as 500 mg per can (the amount in 14 cans of cola). [4.6]\nHigh sugar content. Because of the excessive sugar content in some energy drinks, they carry the same health risks associated with other sugar-sweetened beverages. See Sugary Drinks.\nDangers with alcohol. A greater danger is introduced if energy drinks are combined with alcohol, a trend largely seen in underage drinkers and associated with binge drinking. Studies suggest that drinking this type of cocktail leads to a greater alcohol intake than if just drinking alcohol alone. This may be because energy drinks increase alertness that masks the signs of inebriation, leading one to believe they can consume even more alcohol. [1] In case reports, high consumption of energy drinks\u2014especially when mixed with alcohol\u2014has been linked to adverse cardiovascular, psychological, and neurologic events, including fatal events. [2]\nLack of regulation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate energy drinks but enforces a caffeine limit of 71 mg per 12 ounces of soda; energy drinks typically contain about 120 mg per 12 ounces. However, energy drink manufacturers may choose to classify their product as a supplement to sidestep the caffeine limit. For companies that classify their energy drinks as beverages, the American Beverage Association published voluntary guidelines that advise accurate listings of caffeine content, restriction of marketing to children, and reporting of adverse events to the FDA. However, compliance to these guidelines has been found to be low. [1]\nAthletic performance. Caffeine is the primary ingredient in energy drinks shown in adults to enhance physical performance by increasing endurance and strength, improving reaction time, and delaying fatigue, though the effects are highly variable among persons. (6) These effects have not been studied in children and adolescents.",

(6) These effects have not been studied in children and adolescents. There is a risk of caffeine abuse or toxicity in youth, so the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a limit of less than 100 mg caffeine daily for ages 12-18 years. [1]\n\nThe International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) issued a position statement on energy drinks after analyzing their safety and efficacy. (8) They concluded that consuming energy drinks 10-60 minutes before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance, and endurance in adults, largely through the effects of caffeine. However, other ingredients in these drinks require more study to demonstrate their safety and effects on performance. ISSN cautioned that higher-calorie energy drinks can lead to weight gain, and that their high glycemic load could negatively affect blood glucose and insulin levels. They discouraged use of energy drinks for children and adolescents unless under careful parental monitoring, and for people with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who could be negatively affected by the stimulant ingredients.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Nutrition and the Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness encourage pediatric health care providers to discourage the use of and discuss potential health risks of stimulant ingredients in energy drinks with youth and parents, and to limit or avoid sugar-sweetened beverages of any kind in youth due to risk of excessive calorie intake and weight gain, as well as dental erosion. [7]\u00a0\n\n\n\nBottom Line\nWater that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. Energy drinks are a source of caffeine that people may choose as an alternative to coffee or tea. However, they also contain high amounts of sugar, vitamins, and herbs that may not be necessary for the average person. Energy drinks can pose a health risk in vulnerable groups including children, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with medical conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adults who choose to consume energy drinks should check the label for caffeine content and avoid high consumption (over 200 mg of caffeine per drink); consumption in combination with alcohol should be avoided. [9] Pediatricians should discuss the use of energy drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully.

(41,46,52-54,61)\nTaking action against sugary drinks\nResearch shows that sugary drinks are one of the major determinants of obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence indicates that high consumption of sugary drinks increases the risk for heart disease, the number one killer of men and women in the U.S.\nReducing our preference for sweet beverages will require concerted action on several levels\u2014from creative food scientists and marketers in the beverage industry, as well as from individual consumers and families, schools and worksites, and state and federal government.\nWe must work together toward this worthy and urgent cause: alleviating the cost and the burden of chronic diseases associated with the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the United States.\nHere are steps that each of these groups can take to address the issue:\nBeverage manufacturers: Create beverages that have much less sugar.\nBeverage manufacturers can make it easier for everyone to drink more healthfully by creating beverages that are less sweet. A good target: Beverages that have no more than 1 gram of sugar per ounce, and are free of non-caloric sweeteners (such as sucralose, aspartame, or stevia). This is about 70 percent less sugar than a typical soft drink.\nWe also encourage beverage manufacturers to offer smaller (8 ounce) single-serving bottles of sugary drinks, and encourage their sales channels to stock these smaller-sized bottles. If you read the fine print on the Nutrition Facts label, you\u2019ll see that a standard serving of soft drink is 8 ounces, and that each 20-ounce bottle contains 2.5 servings.\nIndividuals: Make healthy drinking your personal priority.\nStart by choosing beverages with few or no calories. Water is best.\nYou can also:\n\nAsk food companies to make sugar-reduced beverages, by calling their customer service numbers, or sending them a message on their Web site comment forms.\n\n\nAsk schools and workplaces to offer filtered water or functioning water fountains.\n\n\nAsk your local stores, schools, and workplaces to carry 8-ounce or 12-ounce containers of sugary drinks, to make it easier for you to choose a smaller serving.\n\nIt is also wise to wean yourself off of artificial sweeteners because of the unanswered questions about the relationship between diet drinks and obesity.\nFood shoppers for the family: Don\u2019t stock sugary drinks at home.",

Schools and workplaces should also make sure that they have functioning water fountains or filtered water available.\nGovernment: Require better labeling on sugary drinks, and scrap sugar subsidies.\nThe FDA should consider requiring companies to list the number of calories per bottle or can\u2014not per serving\u2014on the front of beverage containers. It should also consider creating a new labeling category for low-sugar beverages.\nUnder current labeling regulations, a beverage can be marketed as \u201creduced sugar\u201d if it contains 25 percent fewer calories than the standard version of that beverage. (62)\nA better threshold for low sugar beverages would be 1 gram of sugar per ounce, which is about 70 percent less sugar than a typical soft drink. Sugar-added beverages with more than 50 calories in an 8-ounce serving should carry a warning label about obesity and diabetes.\nGovernment: Implement a soda tax.\nSugared beverages are categorized as food under the food stamp program and thus not taxed in some states. Yale researcher Kelly Brownell makes a strong argument for taxing sugary drinks in the New England Journal of Medicine. (63) Since sugared beverages carry no nutritional value and pose health risks to a consumer, many public health advocates have argued that it is logical to tax them like cigarettes or alcohol.\nGovernment: Regulation of marketing to children.\nRegulating advertising of sugary drinks targeted towards children \u2013 a vulnerable population \u2013 \u00a0through television, the internet or other media is an important strategy in reducing consumption.\nUS initiatives to ban sugary beverages\nNew York City\n\nIn June of 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City proposed a ban on drinks sweetened with sugar that contain more than 25 calories per 8 fluid ounces. The ban would impact \u201csuper-sized\u201d sodas larger than 16 ounces. The mayor cited the staggering rates of obesity in his proposed ban. Many public health officials and health professionals supported the mayor on his bold stand against soda, a major contributor to obesity. Others, however, argued that individuals must take personal responsibility for their beverage choices and their health, and that regulation would be ineffective because large quantities of soda could still be purchased in a few small containers, and the soda ban would not impact all vendors. For example, since the ban would only apply to movie theatres, fast food establishments, and food trucks, a consumer could still purchase an oversized soda at any food mart or grocery store.\nOver the course of the summer and fall of 2012, the debate about Bloomberg\u2019s soda ban raged on. In July, protestors of the ban marched \u2013 many while sipping large sodas \u2013 in City Hall Park. New York City\u2019s Board of Health approved Bloomberg\u2019s plan, and the new rules were set to take effect in March of 2013, but in the meantime the beverage industry and many restaurant owners filed a lawsuit. The proposed law was subsequently struck down in court in March 2013, and Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s subsequent appeal was rejected by a state appeals courts on July 30, 2013.\nThe large sugary drink ban and subsequent debate raises many important public health questions surrounding access to foods and drinks that have been proven to increase obesity and disease risk. Skeptics remain wary that bans such as Bloomberg\u2019s take away an individual\u2019s right to make personal diet related decisions. Some believe that taking away this right may actually backfire by drawing excess attention to unhealthy items like large sodas and spurring a purchasing spree before they are possibly taken away.\nDespite this opposition, there may be significant health benefits to limiting the sale of large sugary drinks. Sugar sweetened beverages are associated with obesity and many related health risks such as type 2 diabetes. New research also suggests that consuming sugar sweetened beverages also amplifies the genetic risk of obesity.",

Sugar sweetened beverages are associated with obesity and many related health risks such as type 2 diabetes. New research also suggests that consuming sugar sweetened beverages also amplifies the genetic risk of obesity. We support bans like this because the obesity epidemic causes serious health consequences to individuals and places a large burden \u2013 both socially and economically \u2013 on aspects of our society such as healthcare. By limiting access to foods and drinks that have been proven to increase obesity and disease risk, individual consumers may be less likely to purchase these items and may instead shift towards healthier foods and drinks.\nBoston\nIn a move to trim Boston\u2019s rising obesity rates, Mayor Thomas Menino banned the sale and advertising of sugary drinks from city-owned buildings and city-sponsored events.\n\nThe executive order, signed in 2011, calls for city departments to phase out regular sodas, sports drinks, and other high-sugar beverages from their vending machines, cafeterias, and concessions. (64)\n\n\nIn their place, the city will offer healthier beverage options\u2014among them, water, flavored seltzer, unsweetened coffee and tea, and diet drinks.\n\n\nSugary drink marketing, from logos on vending machines to banners at events, will also be barred.\n\nBoston, which barred soda and junk food from public school vending machines in 2004, is not alone in its broader beverage ban effort.\n\nBoston\u2019s Carney Hospital also announced in 2011 that it would ban high sugar beverages from hospital grounds, making it the first hospital in the city to do so. (65)\n\n\nCleveland Clinic banned high sugar drinks from its vending machines and cafeterias in August 2010. (66)\n\n\nSan Francisco, (67) Los Angeles County, (68), and other cities have also curtailed sugary drink sales on municipal property.\n\nThe goal of these bans is to make healthy drinks easy choices\u2014and to counter the billions of dollars beverage manufacturers spent each year on soft drink marketing. That\u2019s just the type of environmental support Americans need to curb their taste for sugar-loaded drinks, public health experts say\u2014and in turn, potentially curb the obesity epidemic.\n\u201cThere is abundant evidence that the huge increase in soda consumption in the past 40 years is the most important single factor behind America\u2019s obesity epidemic,\u201d says Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Dept. of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, who joined Mayor Menino at the soda ban\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese steps will greatly assist in creating a new social norm, in which healthier beverages are the preferred choice.\u201d\nThe city has also unveiled a \u201ctraffic-light\u201d style promotional campaign to help consumers choose healthier beverages based on their sugar and nutrient content. The campaign, which groups beverages into \u201cred\u201d (limit), \u201cyellow\u201d (drink occasionally), and \u201cgreen\u201d (best choice) categories, is similar to the \u201cHow Sweet Is It\u201d beverage guidelines developed by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Department of Nutrition in 2009.\nSee Boston\u2019s traffic light brochure and poster on how to choose healthy beverages.\nReferences\n41.

Other names for LCS are non-nutritive sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, sugar substitutes, and high-intensity sweeteners.\nLCS are found in many beverages and foods like frozen desserts, yogurt, candies, baked goods, chewing gum, breakfast cereals, gelatins, and puddings. Foods and beverages containing LCS sometimes carry the label \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201cdiet.\u201d Some LCS can be used as general purpose sweeteners.\nBecause LCS are many times sweeter than table sugar, they can be used in smaller amounts to achieve the same level of sweetness as sugar. People may use LCS in place of sugar to consume fewer calories or less sugar or to better control their blood glucose if they have diabetes or prediabetes.\nThere are six LCS approved as food additives by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [1] Numerous studies have been conducted on each type to identify possible toxic effects. They are all sweeter than table sugar (sucrose) but contain few or no calories. They include:\n\n\n\n\nLow-Calorie Sweetener\nBrand Names\u2020\nSweetness as compared with sugar\nAcceptable Daily Intake* (maximum number of tabletop sweetener packets per day)\n\n\nAspartame\nEqual\u00ae, NutraSweet\u00ae, Sugar Twin\u00ae\n200 times sweeter than sugar\n75**\n\n\nAcesulfame-K\nSunett\u00ae, Sweet One\u00ae\n200 times sweeter than sugar\n23\n\n\nSaccharin\nSweet\u2019N Low\u00ae, Sweet Twin\u00ae, Necta Sweet\u00ae\n200-700 times sweeter than sugar\n45\n\n\nSucralose\nSplenda\u00ae\n600 times sweeter than sugar\n23\n\n\nNeotame\nNewtame\u00ae\n7,000-13,000 times sweeter than sugar\n23\n\n\nAdvantame\nNo brand names\n20,000 times sweeter than\u00a0sugar\n4,920",

Calculations are based on a 132 pound individual.\n**People with a rare hereditary disease known as phenylketonuria (PKU) have difficulty breaking down phenylalanine, a component of aspartame, and should limit their intake of phenylalanine from all sources, including aspartame.\n\u2020The inclusion of brand-names on this list is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.\n\n\nTwo other LCS are permitted for specific conditions of use in the food supply through the FDA\u2019s GRAS (\u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d) notification program:\n\nCertain Steviol Glycosides, which come from the South American Stevia plant, Stevia rebaudiana.\u00a0\n\nSteviol glycosides are found in foods and beverages in the U.S. under the names Rebaudioside A (or Reb A), Stevioside, Rebaudioside D, or steviol glycoside mixtures that contain Rebaudioside A and/or Stevioside as the main ingredients. Commercial brand names include Truvia\u00ae and PureVia\u00ae. At 200-400 times sweeter than sugar, the Acceptable Daily Intake is 9 packets daily.\nStevia leaf and unrefined stevia extracts are not considered GRAS and are not allowed in the U.S. for use as sweeteners.\n\n\nMonk Fruit, also known as luo han guo or\u00a0Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle fruit extract (SGFE), comes from a plant native to Southern China.\n\nMonk fruit is 100-250 times sweeter than sugar.\nAn Acceptable Daily Intake has not yet been determined.",
        "d58662d1-1de1-4427-a48b-a692b8970c68": "Monk Fruit, also known as luo han guo or\u00a0Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle fruit extract (SGFE), comes from a plant native to Southern China.\n\nMonk fruit is 100-250 times sweeter than sugar.\nAn Acceptable Daily Intake has not yet been determined.\n\n\n\nSugar Alcohols\nSugar alcohols, or polyols, are not classified as LCS but have slightly less calories than table sugar. The sweetness of sugar alcohols varies from 25-100% as sweet as sugar. They do not promote tooth decay or cause sharp rises in blood glucose. Examples are sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol. They are found in sugar-free candies, cookies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. They are also used in toothpastes and medicines like cough syrups.\nIn some people, eating high quantities of certain sugar alcohols can cause loose stools or diarrhea. They are absorbed slowly and may cause extra water to be drawn into the intestines. [2] With continued use, people may improve their tolerance.\nMore research is needed on the longer-term use of sugar alcohols. An observational three-year study found an association between erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as stroke and heart attack, in patients with heart disease or risk factors for CVD (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure). [3] When comparing patients with the lowest and highest blood levels of erythritol, the latter had twice the risk of developing a CVD event. It is noted that the researchers only checked blood erythritol once at the start of the study. They further investigated with a separate lab study, and found that exposing human platelets to erythritol increased the risk of blood clot formation. Erythritol occurs naturally in small amounts in fruits, wine, and beer. But the amount of erythritol used as an additive in low-calorie beverages, ice cream, chewing gums, and candies is much higher.\nLow-Calorie Sweeteners and Health\nThe health effects of LCS are inconclusive, with research showing mixed findings. Research is also looking at potential differences in effects from the various types of LCS. The following reviews research specific to LCS beverages.\n\nA large observational study of French women showed that both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and LCS beverages were linked with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [4] The authors noted that a high intake of SSBs has been associated with weight gain, possibly due to lower satiety and increased blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance. LCS beverages may also cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and a sweet preference in some people.\nWith observational studies, it should be noted that the theory of reverse causation is also possible (for example, when people who are overweight or have prediabetes begin drinking LCS beverages to improve their blood sugar control, which produces a false association between higher LCS beverage intake and future risk of developing diabetes). Reverse causation may explain the finding from a meta-analysis of 17 cohort studies showing an 18% higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with SSBs and 25% higher incidence with LCS beverages, compared with no intake of these drinks. [5]\n\nIn a detailed analysis of data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the positive association observed between LCS beverage intake and type 2 diabetes incidence was largely explained by higher baseline BMI and metabolic conditions, which might have led to increased use of LCS beverages in the first place. [6]",
        "18fcc3f8-7bef-4742-8b61-b0466a2dbf4c": "In three large prospective cohort studies of U.S. men and women, intake of SSBs was associated with an average 3-pound weight gain within each 4-year time period. Substituting the same amount of SSBs with water or LCS beverages was associated with less weight gain (about 1 pound) within each 4-year time span. [7]\nFor adults trying to wean themselves from sugary soda, diet soda is a possible short-term substitute, best used in small amounts over a short period of time. For children, the long-term effects of consuming LCS beverages are unknown, so it\u2019s best for kids to limit their intake. [8]\n\nWeight Control\nLong-term observational studies show that regular consumption of LCS beverages reduces calorie intake and promotes less weight gain or weight maintenance, but other research shows no effect, and some studies even show weight gain. [9] Randomized controlled trials also show mixed findings, although most have shown a modest reduction in weight. [10] Most of these studies are short-term with a small number of participants, making it difficult to provide definitive conclusions on LCS beverages and weight control. Different comparisons among studies may also produce different results; for example, was LCS beverage intake being compared with SSBs, juice, or water?\nThe human brain responds to sweetness with signals to eat more. By providing a sweet taste without any calories, however, LCS beverages may cause us to crave more sweet foods and drinks, which can add up to excess calories. Although hypothetical and not proven in human studies, research is actively looking at proposed mechanisms of LCS beverages that may affect appetite and weight:\n\nDo repeated exposures to the sweet taste of LCS promote a preference for sweets in the diet?\nDoes the sweet taste of LCS stimulate an insulin response even though blood glucose does not change, leading to an increased appetite and food intake?\nIf LCS beverages (as compared with SSBs) do not release hormones in the stomach that signal satisfaction, may a person increase their food intake due to hunger?\nAnimal studies have shown that LCS can change gut microbiota, leading to weight gain and increased blood glucose levels. Would a similar effect be found in human studies?\n\nAt the University of California-San Diego, researchers performed functional MRI scans as volunteers took small sips of water sweetened with sugar or sucralose. Sugar activated regions of the brain involved in food reward, while sucralose didn\u2019t. [11] It is possible, the authors say, that sucralose \u201cmay not fully satisfy a desire for natural caloric sweet ingestion.\u201d So, while sugar signals a positive feeling of reward, LCS may not be an effective way to manage a craving for sweets.\n\n\nLCS and Cancer?\nThe use of LCS is associated with perceived health risks such as cancer, partially due to earlier research and policy measures concerning the artificial sweeteners saccharin and aspartame. However, these findings were disregarded after extensive review. Since then, there have been no large or long-term human studies to indicate a link between LCS and cancer.\n\nThe first connection with cancer was spurred by the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act of 1977, under which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all saccharin-containing products to bear a label stating, \u201cUse of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.\u201d\n\nThe Act was based on early studies that found a cancer connection, but only in a specific type of rat. Out of 20 studies in laboratory rats that were given high dosages of saccharin for more than one year, none found an increased incidence of bladder cancers, except one, that used a particular breed of male rat susceptible to bladder infections. [12] Scientists determined that the rats naturally had high amounts of protein and calcium phosphate in their urine, which when combined with saccharin, could produce substances that damaged bladder tissue, leading to increased risk of cancer.\nHowever, in 2000 the saccharin warning labels were removed because scientists from the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences determined, after reviewing additional research, that humans do not have this same reaction in urine and therefore would not be at increased risk for bladder cancer. In 2001, the FDA declared saccharin safe for consumption and in 2010 the Environmental Protection Agency stated that saccharin was no longer considered a potential hazard to human health. [13] Additional research in humans using retrospective records of the use of LCS (specifically artificial sweeteners) and rates of bladder cancer has found no association. [11] Saccharin remains the oldest and most researched LCS.",
        "07c40eb1-1c87-4570-a4d6-ce440757e6c1": "In 1996, an unsettling scientific study suggested that the rate of increasing brain tumors since 1980 could be caused by aspartame, an artificial LCS introduced in 1981. Although popular media messages advocated avoiding aspartame products, the scientific community criticized the study for its lack of evidence. The study did not evaluate if people with brain tumors had consumed aspartame; rather it demonstrated only an observation of two events occurring simultaneously. [11] A review of large epidemiological and case-control studies did not find an association of aspartame intake with various cancers.[14]\n\nThat said, aspartame has been linked with other side effects, such as headaches and migraines in some adults and children. Numerous complaints have been made to the FDA about side effects of headache and dizziness after consuming aspartame. Though isolated case reports have confirmed headaches due to aspartame intake, randomized clinical trials have shown mixed results. [15, 16]\n\n\nIn 2023, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organization, and the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives released a risk assessment of aspartame and cancer. [17]\u00a0It classified aspartame as a Group 2B carcinogen having \u201climited evidence\u201d for cancer in humans, specifically liver cancer. Their prior recommendation of an acceptable daily intake of aspartame of 40 mg/kg of body weight did not change, as they acknowledged that their research review did not provide differing evidence to alter this guideline, and affirmed that an intake within this range is safe. For a 150-pound (68 kg) woman, this would mean a limit of 2,727 mg of aspartame daily, equivalent to about eleven 12-ounce cans of diet soda (one can contains about 250 mg). They stated that the evidence on cancer risk in humans based on animal and human studies was not convincing, and that more research, specifically longer-term studies with follow-up and randomized controlled trials, were needed.\n\n\n\nScientific Advisory\nA 2011 statement from the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association concluded that when used judiciously, non-nutritive sweeteners (including low-calorie sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, and non-caloric sweeteners) might help with weight loss or control, and could also have beneficial metabolic effects. The statement also points out, however, that these potential benefits will not be fully realized if there is a compensatory increase in energy intake from other sources\u2014ultimately saying that at this time there is insufficient data to make a conclusive determination about using non-nutritive sweeteners; more research is needed. [18]\nThe American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association followed this with a 2018 scientific advisory specific to LCS beverages and cardiometabolic health. [8] The report cited the decline in consumption of both SSBs and LCS beverages in the United States, suggesting that it is possible to reduce SSBs without necessarily increasing LCS beverage intake. The advisory outlined the following summary points:\n\nChildren should not drink LCS beverages in the long-term because of unknown effects. If there is a potential increased risk in adults of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events with diet beverage intake, the risk could be heightened in a child due to their smaller body size and earlier exposure.\nFor adults who are regular high consumers of SSBs, LCS beverages may be a useful temporary replacement strategy to reduce intake of SSBs. This may be particularly helpful for those who are used to a sweet-tasting beverage and for whom water, at least initially, is an undesirable option.\nAlternatives to LCS beverages and SSBs, such as plain, carbonated, or unsweetened flavored waters, should be encouraged for all.\nThe potential benefits from LCS beverages as replacements for SSBs will not be fully realized if their use is offset by an increase in calorie intake from other foods or beverages. Additionally, an overall healthful dietary pattern is recommended.\nFurther research on the effects of LCS beverages on weight control, cardiometabolic risk factors, and risk of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases is needed.\n\nRelated\nUnpacking WHO guidelines on non-sugar sweeteners\n\n\nReferences\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.

It flavors food and is used as a binder and stabilizer. It is also a food preservative, as bacteria can\u2019t thrive in the presence of a high amount of salt. The human body requires a small amount of sodium to conduct nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and maintain the proper balance of water and minerals. It is estimated that we need about 500 mg of sodium daily for these vital functions. But too much sodium in the diet can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. It can also cause calcium losses, some of which may be pulled from bone. Most Americans consume at least 1.5 teaspoons of salt per day, or about 3400 mg of sodium, which contains far more than our bodies need.\nRecommended Amounts\nThe U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes state that there is not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance or a toxic level for sodium (aside from chronic disease risk). Because of this, a Tolerable Upper intake Level (UL) has not been established; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.\u00a0\nGuidelines for Adequate Intakes (AI) of sodium were established based on the lowest levels of sodium intake used in randomized controlled trials that did not show a deficiency but that also allowed for an adequate intake of nutritious foods naturally containing sodium. For men and women 14 years of age and older and pregnant women, the AI is 1,500 milligrams a day.\nA Chronic Disease Risk Reduction (CDRR) Intake has also been established, based on the evidence of benefit of a reduced sodium intake on the risk of cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Reducing sodium intakes below the CDRR is expected to lower the risk of chronic disease in the general healthy population. The CDRR lists 2,300 milligrams a day as the maximum amount to consume for chronic disease reduction for men and women 14 years of age and older and pregnant women. Most people in the U.S. consume more sodium than the AI or CDRR guidelines. [1]\nTypes of Salt\nFinely ground salts are dense, so they tend to contain more sodium than coarser salts.

The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.\u00a0\nSodium and Health\nIn most people, the kidneys have trouble keeping up with excess sodium in the blood. As sodium accumulates, the body holds onto water to dilute the sodium. This increases both the amount of fluid surrounding cells and the volume of blood in the bloodstream. Increased blood volume means more work for the heart and more pressure on blood vessels. Over time, the extra work and pressure can stiffen blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. It can also lead to heart failure. There is some evidence that too much salt can damage the heart, aorta, and kidneys without increasing blood pressure, and that it may be bad for bones, too. Learn more about the health risks and disease related to salt and sodium:\n\n\nCardiovascular disease\nAfter conducting a review on sodium research, the Institute of Medicine concluded that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure, but evidence of a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is inconclusive. [2] It is clear, however, that high blood pressure is a leading cause of CVD. It accounts for two-thirds of all strokes and half of heart disease. [3] In China, high blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for more than one million deaths a year. [4]\nThere may be a genetic component to salt intake, as people respond differently to lower sodium intakes. [2] Those who are \u201csalt-sensitive\u201d experience the greatest blood pressure reductions after following a reduced sodium diet. Those who are \u201csalt-resistant\u201d do not experience these changes even with significant increases in sodium intake. Studies have found that women more than men, people older than 50 years, African-Americans, and those with a higher starting blood pressure respond the greatest to reduced sodium intake. [5,6] However, there is not enough evidence to make strong conclusions about specific groups who may be salt-resistant; the overall evidence supports a benefit of limiting sodium intake for everyone, even though the optimal target amount is not clear.\nObservational and clinical research has found that higher sodium intakes are associated with cardiovascular diseases and related deaths. The following are key studies:\n\nIntersalt: Researchers measured the amount of sodium excreted over a 24-hour period (a good stand-in for salt intake) among more than 10,000 adults from 32 countries. The average was nearly 4,000 mg of sodium a day. Yet the range was huge, from 200 mg a day among the Yanomamo people of Brazil to 10,300 mg in northern Japan. [7] Populations with higher salt consumption had higher average blood pressures and greater increases of blood pressures with age. Four groups of people\u2014the four countries with salt intakes less than 1,300 mg per day\u2014had low average blood pressures and little or no upward trend of blood pressure with age.\n\nThe authors conducted a re-review and update on the Intersalt data. [8] They found: 1) a stronger association than their prior study with higher sodium intakes and higher blood pressure, and 2) a stronger association with higher sodium intakes and higher blood pressure in middle age participants as compared with younger adults.",
        "388d12df-997e-4649-af25-bf23c8fc4366": "TOHP: The two Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) were conducted from 1987-1995. [9,10] They tested the impact of lifestyle changes on blood pressure, such as weight loss, stress management, nutritional supplements, and consuming less sodium. In each of the studies, small decreases in blood pressure were seen with sodium reduction over 18-36 months. Years after the trials had ended, the researchers surveyed the participants and found that:\n\nAfter an average of 10-15 years, the TOHP participants in the sodium-reduction groups were 25% less likely to have had a heart attack or stroke, to have needed a procedure to open or bypass a cholesterol-clogged coronary artery, or to have died of cardiovascular disease.\nThe higher the ratio of potassium to sodium in a participant\u2019s diet, the lower the chances were of developing cardiovascular trouble. This suggests that a strategy that includes both increasing potassium and lowering sodium may be the most effective way to fight high blood pressure.\n\n\nTOHP Follow-up Study: A continuation of the two previous TOHP trials in 2000 that looked specifically at CVD or deaths from CVD. [11] When participants with sodium intakes less than 2,300 mg daily were compared with those who had intakes of 3,600-4,800 mg, there was a 32% lower risk of developing CVD. There was also a continuing decrease in CVD-related events (stroke, heart attack) with decreasing sodium intakes as low as 1,500 mg daily.\nDASH: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trials, begun in 1994, were major advances in blood pressure research, demonstrating the links between diet and blood pressure. [12,13]\n\nIn the first study, 459 participants were randomly assigned to either 1) a standard American diet high in red meat and sugars, and low in fiber, 2) a similar diet that was richer in fruits and vegetables, or 3) the \u201cDASH diet,\u201d which emphasized fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy foods, and limited red meat, saturated fats, and sweets. After eight weeks, the fruits and vegetables diet and DASH diet reduced systolic (the top number of a blood pressure reading) and diastolic (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) blood pressure, with the DASH diet producing a stronger effect.\nThe second study found that lowering sodium in either the DASH or standard American diet had an even stronger impact on reducing blood pressure. The DASH study contributed much of the scientific basis for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010, which recommends reducing daily sodium to less than a teaspoon.\n\n\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials found that a moderate sodium reduction to about 4,000 mg a day for at least one month caused significant reductions in blood pressure in individuals with both normal and high blood pressure. Further analysis showed that blood pressure was reduced in both men and women and white and black races, suggesting a benefit for the total population. [6]\n\nAssessing people\u2019s sodium intakes can be tricky, and the most accurate method known is to measure 24-urine samples over several days. This is the method Harvard researchers used when pooling data from 10,709 generally healthy adults from six prospective cohorts including the Nurses Health Studies I and II, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease study, and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Follow-up studies. [22] They looked at both sodium and potassium intakes in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (as noted by a heart attack, stroke, or procedure or surgery needed to repair heart damage), and measured two or more urine samples per participant. After controlling for CVD risk factors, they found that a higher sodium intake was associated with higher CVD risk. For every 1,000 mg increase of urinary sodium per day, there was an 18% increased risk of CVD. But for every 1,000 mg increase of potassium, there was an 18% lower risk of CVD. They also found that a higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was associated with higher CVD risk, that is, eating a higher proportion of salty foods to potassium-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy.",
        "178d7569-18aa-47b1-9df5-38570bac047b": "Chronic kidney disease\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) shares risk factors with cardiovascular disease, with high blood pressure being a major risk factor for both. Salt sensitivity is reported to be more prevalent in patients with CKD due to a reduced ability to excrete sodium, which may lead to increased blood pressure. [14]\nAlthough there is evidence that links high sodium intake with high blood pressure, there is not adequate evidence that a low sodium restriction protects against or causes better outcomes of CKD than a moderate sodium restriction. One systematic review of patients diagnosed with CKD found that high sodium intakes of greater than 4,600 mg a day were associated with progression of CKD, but low sodium intakes less than 2,300 mg a day had no significant effect when compared with moderate sodium intakes of 2,300-4,600 mg a day. [14]\nGuidelines generally advise a moderate rather than low sodium restriction to prevent the development and progression of CKD. A daily sodium intake of less than 4,000 mg is recommended for overall management of CKD, and less than 3,000 mg daily for CKD with symptoms of fluid retention or proteinuria, a condition in which excess protein is excreted in the urine. [15]\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoporosis\nThe amount of calcium that your body loses via urination increases with the amount of salt you eat. If calcium is in short supply in the blood, it can leach out of bones. So a diet high in sodium could have an additional unwanted effect\u2014the bone-thinning disease known as osteoporosis. [3] A study in post-menopausal women showed that the loss of hip bone density over two years was related to the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion at the start of the study, and that the connection with bone loss was as strong as that for calcium intake. [16] Other studies have shown that reducing salt intake causes a positive calcium balance, suggesting that reducing salt intake could slow the loss of calcium from bone that occurs with aging.\n\n\n\n\nCancer\nResearch shows that a higher intake of salt, sodium, or salty foods is linked to an increase in stomach cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research concluded that salt, as well as salted and salty foods, are a \u201cprobable cause of stomach cancer.\u201d [17]\n\n\n\nFood Sources\nSodium isn\u2019t generally a nutrient that you need to look for; it finds you. Almost any unprocessed food like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, meats, and dairy foods is low in sodium. Most of the salt in our diets comes from commercially prepared foods, not from salt added to cooking at home or even from salt added at the table before eating. [1,18]\nAccording to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the top 10 sources of sodium in our diets include: breads/rolls; pizza; sandwiches; cold cuts/cured meats; soups; burritos, tacos; savory snacks (chips, popcorn, pretzels, crackers); chicken; cheese; eggs, omelets.\nAre \u201cnatural\u201d salts healthier than table salt?Salt is harvested from salt mines or by evaporating ocean water. All types of salt are made of sodium chloride, and the nutrient content varies minimally. Although less processed salts contain small amounts of minerals, the amount is not enough to offer substantial nutritional benefit. Different salts are chosen mainly for flavor.\nThe most widely used, table salt, is extracted from underground salt deposits. It is heavily processed to remove impurities, which may also remove trace minerals. It is then ground very fine. Iodine, a trace mineral, was added to salt in 1924 to prevent goiter and hypothyroidism, medical conditions caused by iodine deficiency. Table salt also often contains an anticaking agent such as calcium silicate to prevent clumps from forming.\nKosher salt is a coarsely grained salt named for its use in traditional Kosher food preparation. Kosher salt does not typically contain iodine but may have an anti-caking agent.\nSea salt is produced by evaporating ocean or sea water. It is also composed mostly of sodium chloride, but sometimes contains small amounts of minerals like potassium, zinc, and iron depending on where it was harvested. Because it is not highly refined and ground like table salt, it may appear coarser and darker with an uneven color, indicating the remaining impurities and nutrients. Unfortunately, some of these impurities can contain metals found in the ocean, like lead. The coarseness and granule size will vary by brand.\nHimalayan pink salt is harvested from mines in Pakistan. Its pink hue comes from small amounts of iron oxide.",

Its pink hue comes from small amounts of iron oxide. Similar to sea salt, it is less processed and refined and therefore the crystals appear larger and contain small amounts of minerals including iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium.\nLarger, coarser salt granules do not dissolve as easily or evenly in cooking, but offer a burst of flavor. They are best used sprinkled onto meats and vegetables before cooking or immediately after. They should not be used in baking recipes. Keep in mind that measurements of different salts are not always interchangeable in recipes. Generally, sea salt and table salt can be interchanged if the granule size is similar. However, table salt tends to have more concentrated, saltier flavor than kosher salt, so the substitution is one teaspoon of table salt for about 1.5 to 2 teaspoons of kosher salt depending on the brand.\n\nSigns of Deficiency and Toxicity\nDeficiency\nA deficiency of sodium in the U.S. is rare because it is so commonly added to a wide variety of foods and occurs naturally in some foods. Hyponatremia is the term used to describe abnormally low amounts of sodium in the blood. This occurs mainly in older adults, particularly those living in long-term care facilities or hospitals who take medications or have health conditions that deplete the body of sodium, leading to hyponatremia. Excess vomiting, diarrhea, and sweating can also cause hyponatremia if salt is lost in these fluids that are expelled from the body. Sometimes too much fluid abnormally collecting in the body can lead to hyponatremia, which might stem from diseases such as heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In rare cases, simply drinking too much fluid can lead to hyponatremia if the kidneys can\u2019t excrete the excess water. Symptoms of hyponatremia can include: nausea, vomiting, headaches, altered mental state/confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma.\nToxicity\nToo much sodium in the blood is called hypernatremia. This acute condition can happen in older adults who are mentally and physically impaired who do not eat or drink enough, or who are sick with a high fever, vomiting, or infection that causes severe dehydration. Excessive sweating or diuretic medications that deplete the body of water are other causes. When sodium accumulates in the blood, water is transferred out of cells and into the blood to dilute it. This fluid shift and a build-up of fluid in the brain can cause seizures, coma, or even death. Extra fluid collecting in the lungs can cause difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of hypernatremia can include: nausea, vomiting, weakness, loss of appetite, intense thirst, confusion, kidney damage.\nThe interplay of sodium and potassiumSodium and potassium are closely interconnected but have opposite effects in the body. Both are essential nutrients that play key roles in maintaining physiological balance, and both have been linked to the risk of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease. High salt intake increases blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, while high potassium intake can help relax blood vessels and excrete sodium while decreasing blood pressure. Our bodies need far more potassium than sodium each day, but the typical U.S. diet is just the opposite: Americans average about 3,300 milligrams of sodium per day, about 75% of which comes from processed foods, while only getting about 2,900 milligrams of potassium each day. [19,20]\nA study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that:\n\nPeople who ate high-sodium, low-potassium diets had a higher risk of dying from a heart attack or any cause. In this study, people with the highest sodium intakes had a 20% higher risk of death from any cause than people with the lowest sodium intakes.",
        "5710fa08-9ed0-4c16-8838-b79f84cb36a0": "High salt intake increases blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, while high potassium intake can help relax blood vessels and excrete sodium while decreasing blood pressure.

People with the highest potassium intakes had a 20% lower risk of dying than people with the lowest intakes. But what may be even more important for health is the relationship of sodium to potassium in the diet. People with the highest ratio of sodium to potassium in their diets had double the risk of dying of a heart attack than people with the lowest ratio, and they had a 50% higher risk of death from any cause. [21]\nPeople can make a key dietary change to help lower their risk: Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits, which are naturally high in potassium and low in sodium, but eat less bread, cheese, processed meat, and other processed foods that are high in sodium and low in potassium.\n\n\nRelated\nTake Action: How to Reduce Your Sodium Intake\nPublic Health Concerns: Salt and Sodium\nVitamins and Minerals\n\n\nReferences\n\nDietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium.

Childhood is an important time to focus on preventing the development of high blood pressure, but cutting back on salt and sodium can have a significant impact for people of all ages.\nCut back on prepared foods\nAbout 70% of the sodium Americans eat comes from processed, prepared foods such as crackers, cheese, and canned foods, and restaurant meals. [1]\nEven processed foods that don\u2019t taste \u201csalty\u201d\u2014like breakfast cereal\u2014can have surprisingly high sodium levels. Additionally, foods consumed numerous times a day, such as bread, can add up to higher sodium intake even though an individual serving is not high in sodium.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, top sources of sodium in the American diet include breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, fresh and processed chicken, soups, sandwiches, cheese, egg dishes, and packaged savory snacks. Prepared sauces, salad dressings, and gravies also tend to be high in sodium.\nChoosing foods with lower sodium doesn\u2019t mean losing flavor. Human taste buds aren\u2019t sensitive enough to notice a minor reduction in salt of about 30%, and for many types of foods, salt reductions of up to 30% won\u2019t taste noticeably different. This means that home cooks, professional chefs, and the food industry can make significant sodium reductions with minimal impact on flavor.\nEat smaller portions of salty foods\nThere\u2019s no need to completely eliminate favorite high-sodium foods or traditional cultural cuisines such as soy sauce (China), salted pickles and fish (Japan), or salty cheese and olives (Greece, Italy). Instead, it\u2019s best to enjoy such foods in smaller amounts.\nDiscover reduced or no-sodium alternatives\nSalt substitutes, including herbs and spices, and citrus like lemon can provide more flavor with less sodium. For example, citrus and sodium activate the same taste sensors so that less sodium can be used when they are combined. Explore your supermarket for low-sodium versions of traditional high-salt products, or experiment with new alternatives.\nThe Food and Drug Administration requires a \u201clow-sodium\u201d labeled food to contain less than 140 mg per serving. However, in foods where salt is a key component, such as soy sauce or cold cuts, the best a manufacturer can do is reduce the amount.  In this case, the label can say \u201cless sodium\u201d or \u201clower sodium\u201d although it may still be a high-sodium food. For example, one tablespoon of \u201cless-sodium\u201d soy sauce contains about 550 mg, as compared with 1,000 mg in the regular version. One serving of \u201clower-sodium\u201d deli turkey breast contains about 380 mg\u2014not much different from 450 mg in regular deli-sliced turkey.\nSodium-free substitutes contain 100% potassium chloride, while \u201clite\u201d salts replace up to half of the table salt with potassium chloride. Potassium chloride (also called potassium salt) tastes much like sodium chloride, but it has a bitter aftertaste when heated so it is not recommended for cooking. However, check with your doctor before trying a potassium salt, because extra potassium can be dangerous for people who have trouble eliminating excess amounts or who are taking medications that can increase potassium levels in the bloodstream. This includes people with diabetes or kidney disease, those who have had a blocked urinary flow, or those taking a potassium-sparing diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-receptor blocker.\nCook your own meals\nInstead of eating processed foods and restaurant meals, focus on cooking with fresh ingredients. Cooking with fresh unprocessed ingredients allows you to control the amount of salt (if any) you decide to add to your meals.\nTo get started, explore our recipes, including these tasty, low-sodium options:\nCardamom Roasted CauliflowerRoasting cauliflower and other vegetables create a sweet, caramelized flavor.

[1] This epidemic places a huge burden on the healthcare system and on our economy, estimated at $73.4 billion in direct and indirect costs for 2009 alone. [2]\nResearchers estimate that reducing the average daily sodium intake in the U.S. to 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) per day would prevent 11 million cases of hypertension and would save $18 billion in health care costs each year. [3]\nAnother study estimates that cutting average daily sodium consumption by 1,200 milligrams (about \u00bd teaspoon of salt) would prevent up to 99,000 heart attacks and 66,000 strokes, and would save up to 92,000 lives a year. Researchers also estimated that such sodium reductions would save $24 billion in health costs [4]. Smaller cutbacks would save also save lives and be cost-effective, and this is true for developed countries as well, where excess salt is an even greater problem, could have a more substantial impact.\nMany players in the food industry have already taken the lead in reducing sodium, but broad-scale sodium reduction may also require action from the government and political sectors.\nRegulating the amount of salt in prepared foods\nGiven that processed foods contribute to a large portion of people\u2019s sodium intake in the US and Europe, governments have started working with the food industry to lower sodium levels.\nUS initiatives\nCurrently, there is no limit on the amount of sodium allowed in foods, because salt has long been considered to be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (or GRAS)\u2014a regulatory designation called into question by 40 years of research on the hazards of eating too much salt.\nA committee appointed by the Institute of Medicine recommended that the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate the amount of salt in commercially prepared food. The committee\u2019s report,\u00a0Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States, released on April 20, 2010, urges the FDA to work with food companies to ratchet back the amount of salt consumed by Americans, 75 percent of which comes from commercially prepared foods. [5]\u00a0The IOM is not recommending a ban on salt\u2014it is, after all, an essential part of the human diet \u2013 nor immediate changes. What the IOM report calls for is a gradual reduction in salt that would make the changes imperceptible to consumers\u2019 palates.",

[5]\u00a0The IOM is not recommending a ban on salt\u2014it is, after all, an essential part of the human diet \u2013 nor immediate changes. What the IOM report calls for is a gradual reduction in salt that would make the changes imperceptible to consumers\u2019 palates. This would entail having the FDA work with the food industry to set limits on the amount of salt in prepared food, with the limit lowering over time.\u00a0\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0quoted sources at the FDA saying that it could take ten years to phase in these changes.\n\u201cInvolving the FDA would help create and maintain a level playing field for food companies,\u201d says Dr. Walter Willett, Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition and chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health. Salt is such an inexpensive ingredient that, if sodium limits were voluntary, it would be easy for food companies to make products stand out by boosting their salt content compared to those who were voluntarily reducing salt. \u201cRegulation by the FDA would make such end runs difficult and protect the responsible companies that are reducing the sodium content of their products,\u201d says Dr. Willett.\n2021 update: FDA releases voluntary sodium-reduction goalsThe U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released new voluntary guidance on October 13, 2021, encouraging the food industry to gradually reduce sodium\u00a0in commercially processed, packaged, and prepared foods over the next two and a half years\u2014with the aim of helping Americans reduce their average levels of sodium from 3,400 to 3,000 mg/day.\nFrank Sacks, professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, was the principal investigator in the landmark\u00a0Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Sodium-Trial, which rigorously examined the effect of sodium intake on blood pressure, concluding that the relation is strong and causal. He recently spoke about the new FDA guidance, and offered tips for eating a lower-sodium diet without sacrificing taste.\nRead the Q&A with Dr. Sacks\nOther key recommendations include the following:\n\nUpdating food labels to match a Daily Value for sodium of 1,500 milligrams a day (instead of 2,300 milligrams). This would help consumers have a better idea of the level of salt in their foods\u2014and manufacturers would have more of an incentive to cut back on the amount of salt in their products.\nLaunching a nationwide campaign to help consumers change their salt-consumption habits. Industry cutbacks in salt will help lower everyone\u2019s sodium intake, but consumers also need to do their part by choosing healthful foods.\n\nAlthough the recommendations come from the highly regarded Institute of Medicine\u2014an independent, nonprofit organization that provides evidence-based information and advice to the federal government and the public on matters of diet, health, and health care\u2014there is no guarantee that they will be put into practice. The salt industry has long resisted outside intervention and continues to argue that salt has little influence on blood pressure.\nNew York City\nEncouragingly, some manufacturers have voluntarily agreed to cut back on sodium as part of\u00a0New York City\u2019s National Salt Reduction Initiative. [6] The aim of this initiative is to guide a voluntary reduction of salt levels in packaged and restaurant foods, with the primary goal of cutting the salt in packaged and restaurant foods by 25% over five years \u2013 which would reduce the nation\u2019s salt intake by 20% and prevent thousands of deaths.\nInternational initiatives\nFinland and the United Kingdom have led successful sodium reduction efforts. [7]\nIn Finland, a government-led program of education, salt-labeling legislation, and pressure on the food industry has led to a 30 percent reduction in salt intake, from 12,000 milligrams a day to around 9,000 milligrams today.\nIn the United Kingdom, a partnership between a scientific action group called Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH) and the U.K. Department of Health has led to a 20 to 30 percent reduction in the salt content of processed foods bought in supermarkets.

The\u00a0amount of carbohydrate\u00a0in the diet \u2013 high or low \u2013 is less important than the\u00a0type of carbohydrate\u00a0in the diet. For example, healthy, whole grains such as whole wheat bread, rye, barley and quinoa are better choices than highly refined white bread or French fries. (1)\nMany people are confused about carbohydrates, but keep in mind that it\u2019s more important to eat carbohydrates from healthy foods than to follow a strict diet limiting or counting the number of grams of carbohydrates consumed.\nWhat are carbohydrates?\nCarbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods\u2014bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches.\nFoods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others:\n\nThe healthiest sources of carbohydrates\u2014unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans\u2014promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients.\nUnhealthier sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.\u00a0 These items contain easily digested carbohydrates that may contribute to weight gain, interfere with weight loss, and promote diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThe Healthy Eating Plate recommends filling most of your plate with healthy carbohydrates \u2013 with vegetables (except potatoes) and fruits taking up about half of your plate,\u00a0and whole grains filling up about one fourth of your plate.\nTry these tips for adding healthy carbohydrates to your diet:\n1.\u00a0Start the day with\u00a0whole grains.\nTry a hot cereal, like steel cut or old fashioned oats (not instant oatmeal), or a cold cereal that lists a\u00a0whole grain\u00a0first on the ingredient list and is low in sugar. A good rule of thumb: Choose a cereal that has at least 4 grams of fiber and less than 8 grams of sugar per serving.\n2. Use whole grain breads for lunch or snacks.\nConfused about how to find a whole-grain bread? Look for bread that lists as the first ingredient whole wheat, whole rye, or some other whole grain \u2014and even better, one that is made with\u00a0only\u00a0whole grains, such as 100 percent whole wheat bread.\n3. Also look beyond the bread aisle.\nWhole wheat bread is often made with finely ground flour, and bread products are often high in sodium. Instead of bread, try a whole grain in salad form such as brown rice or quinoa.\n4. Choose whole fruit instead of juice.\nAn orange has two times as much fiber and half as much sugar as a 12-ounce glass of orange juice.\n5. Pass on potatoes, and instead bring on the beans.\nRather than fill up on potatoes \u2013 which have been found to promote weight gain\u00a0 \u2013 choose beans for an excellent source of slowly digested\u00a0carbohydrates. Beans and other legumes such as chickpeas also provide a healthy dose of\u00a0protein.\n\nReferences\n1. Mozaffarian D, Hao T, Rimm EB, Willett WC, Hu FB.

This condition, known as insulin resistance, causes blood sugar and insulin levels to stay high long after eating. Over time, the heavy demands made on the insulin-making cells wears them out, and insulin production eventually stops.\n\nGlycemic index\nIn the past, carbohydrates were commonly classified as being either \u201csimple\u201d or \u201ccomplex,\u201d and described as follows:\nSimple carbohydrates:\nThese carbohydrates are composed of sugars (such as fructose and glucose) which have simple chemical structures composed of only one sugar (monosaccharides) or two sugars (disaccharides). Simple carbohydrates are easily and quickly utilized for energy by the body because of their simple chemical structure, often leading to a faster rise in blood sugar and insulin secretion from the pancreas \u2013 which can have negative health effects.\nComplex carbohydrates:\nThese carbohydrates have more complex chemical structures, with three or more sugars linked together (known as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides).\u00a0 Many complex carbohydrate foods contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, and they take longer to digest \u2013 which means they have less of an immediate impact on blood sugar, causing it to rise more slowly. But other so called complex carbohydrate foods such as white bread and white potatoes contain mostly starch but little fiber or other beneficial nutrients.\nDividing carbohydrates into simple and complex, however, does not account for the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar and chronic diseases. To explain how different kinds of carbohydrate-rich foods directly affect blood sugar, the glycemic index was developed and is considered a better way of categorizing carbohydrates, especially starchy foods.\nThe glycemic index ranks carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 based on how quickly and how much they raise blood sugar levels after eating.",

Foods with a high glycemic index, like white bread, are rapidly digested and cause substantial fluctuations in blood sugar. Foods with a low glycemic index, like whole oats, are digested more slowly, prompting a more gradual rise in blood sugar.\n\nLow-glycemic foods have a rating of 55 or less, and foods rated 70-100 are considered high-glycemic foods. Medium-level foods have a glycemic index of 56-69.\nEating many high-glycemic-index foods \u2013 which cause powerful spikes in blood sugar \u2013 can lead to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, (2) heart disease, (3), (4) and overweight, (5,6) (7). There is also preliminary work linking high-glycemic diets to age-related macular degeneration, (8) ovulatory infertility, (9) and colorectal cancer. (10)\nFoods with a low glycemic index have been shown to help control type 2 diabetes and improve weight loss.\nA 2014 review of studies researching carbohydrate quality and chronic disease risk showed that low-glycemic-index diets may offer anti-inflammatory benefits. (16)\nThe University of Sydney in Australia maintains a searchable database of foods and their corresponding glycemic indices.\n\nMany factors can affect a food\u2019s glycemic index, including the following:\n\nProcessing:\u00a0Grains that have been milled and refined\u2014removing the bran and the germ\u2014have a higher glycemic index than minimally processed whole grains.\nPhysical form:\u00a0Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested than coarsely ground grain. This is why eating whole grains in their \u201cwhole form\u201d like brown rice or oats can be healthier than eating highly processed whole grain bread.\nFiber content:\u00a0High-fiber foods don\u2019t contain as much digestible carbohydrate, so it slows the rate of digestion and causes a more gradual and lower rise in blood sugar. (17)\nRipeness:\u00a0Ripe fruits and vegetables tend to have a higher glycemic index than un-ripened fruit.\nFat content and acid content:\u00a0Meals with fat or acid are converted more slowly into sugar.\n\nNumerous epidemiologic studies have shown a positive association between higher dietary glycemic index and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. However, the relationship between glycemic index and body weight is less well studied and remains controversial.\nGlycemic load\nOne thing that a food\u2019s glycemic index does not tell us is how much digestible carbohydrate \u2013 the total amount of carbohydrates excluding \u00a0fiber \u2013 it delivers. That\u2019s why researchers developed a related way to classify foods that takes into account both the amount of carbohydrate in the food in relation to its impact on blood sugar levels. This measure is called the glycemic load. (11,12) A food\u2019s glycemic load is determined by multiplying its glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate the food contains. In general, a glycemic load of 20 or more is high, 11 to 19 is medium, and 10 or under is low.\nThe glycemic load has been used to study whether or not high-glycemic load diets are associated with increased risks for type 2 diabetes risk and cardiac events. In a large meta-analysis of 24 prospective cohort studies, researchers concluded that people who consumed lower-glycemic load diets were at a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who ate a diet of higher-glycemic load foods.\u00a0(13) A similar type of meta-analysis concluded that higher-glycemic load diets were also associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease events. (14)\nHere is a listing of low, medium, and high glycemic load foods.",

Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body\u2019s use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check.\nChildren and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day. Great sources are\u00a0whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts.\nTypes of Fiber\nFiber comes in two varieties, both beneficial to health:\nSoluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, chia seeds, nuts, beans, lentils, apples, and blueberries.\nInsoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include whole wheat products (especially wheat bran), quinoa, brown rice, legumes, leafy greens like kale, almonds, walnuts, seeds, and fruits with edible skins like pears and apples.\nFurther defining fiberUnder the umbrella terms of insoluble and soluble fibers, you may see fiber described in other ways. It can be viscous with a gel-like quality, or fermentable because it acts as food for gut bacteria that break down and ferment it. Fibers that are not broken down by bacteria, called nonfermentable, travel intact to the colon and can add bulk and weight to stool so it is easier to pass. These properties offer health benefits such as slowing down digestion, delaying blood sugar rises after meals, promoting healthy colonies of bacteria, or having a laxative effect. In addition, there are many subtypes of soluble and insoluble fibers, some of which occur naturally in plant foods and others that are synthetically made.\nThe National Academy of Medicine defines fiber as: 1) dietary fibers (nondigestible carbohydrates and lignans) that occur naturally in plants, and 2) functional fibers that are extracted from plants or synthetically made and are nondigestible with a beneficial health effect in humans. [1] Some types of fiber fall into both categories, such as oligosaccharides and resistant starches that may be naturally occurring or synthetically made.\nNaturally occurring plant fibers: \n\nCellulose, hemicellulose \u2013 Insoluble fiber found in cereal grains and the cell walls of many fruits and vegetables.",

It absorbs water and adds bulk to stool, which can have a laxative effect.\nLignins \u2013 Insoluble fiber found in wheat and corn bran, nuts, flaxseeds, vegetables, and unripe bananas that triggers mucus secretion in the colon and adds bulk to stools. Has laxative effect.\nBeta-glucans \u2013 Soluble highly fermentable fiber found in oats and barley that is metabolized and fermented in the small intestine. Acts as a prebiotic. Can add bulk to stool but does not have a laxative effect. May help to normalize blood glucose and cholesterol levels.\nGuar gum \u2013 Soluble fermentable fiber isolated from seeds. Has a viscous gel texture and is often added to foods as a thickener. It is metabolized and fermented in the small intestine. Does not have a laxative effect. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\nInulin, oligofructose, oligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides \u2013 Soluble fermentable fibers found in onions, chicory root, asparagus, and Jerusalem artichokes. May help to bulk stool with a laxative effect, normalize blood glucose, and act as a prebiotic. People with irritable bowel syndrome may be sensitive to these fibers that can cause bloating or stomach upset.\nPectins \u2013 Soluble highly fermentable fiber found in apples, berries, and other fruits. Minimal bulking or laxative effect. Due to its gelling properties, it may slow digestion and help normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\nResistant starch \u2013 Soluble fermentable fiber found in legumes, unripe bananas, cooked and cooled pasta, and potatoes that acts as a prebiotic. Adds bulk to stools but has minimal laxative effect. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\n\nManufactured functional fibers, some of which are extracted and modified from natural plants:\n\nPsyllium \u2013 Soluble viscous nonfermentable fiber extracted from psyllium seeds that holds onto water and softens and bulks stools. Has laxative effect and is an ingredient in over-the-counter laxatives and high-fiber cereals. May help to normalize blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\nPolydextrose and polyols \u2013 Soluble fiber made of glucose and sorbitol, a sugar alcohol. It can increase stool bulk and have a mild laxative effect. Minimal effect on blood sugar or cholesterol levels. It is a food additive used as a sweetener, to improve texture, maintain moisture, or to increase fiber content.\nInulin, oligosaccharides, pectins, resistant starch, gums \u2013 Soluble fibers derived from plant foods as listed above, but are isolated or modified into a concentrated form that is added to foods or fiber supplements.\n\n\nFiber and Disease\nFiber appears to lower the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation.

Fiber\u2019s beneficial role in the gut microbiome may produce anti-inflammatory effects that alleviate the chronic inflammation associated with these conditions. [2]\n\n\nHeart disease\nSoluble fiber attracts water in the gut, forming a gel, which can slow digestion. This may help prevent blood glucose surges after eating and reduce hunger. Control of blood glucose and weight is important because these are risk factors for diabetes, a condition which doubles the risk of developing heart disease.\nSoluble fiber may also lower blood cholesterol by interfering with bile acid production. Cholesterol is used to make bile acids in the liver. Soluble fiber binds to bile acids in the gut and excretes them from the body. Because of this reduced amount of available bile acids, the liver will pull cholesterol from the blood to make new bile acids, thereby lowering blood cholesterol. [3] A meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials found a modest benefit of dietary soluble fiber in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. [4]\nEpidemiological studies find that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and deaths from cardiovascular disease. [5-7] In large cohorts of male and female health professionals, researchers found that higher intakes of cereal fibers were associated with a lower risk of heart disease and heart attacks. [8,9] Keep in mind that cereal fiber doesn\u2019t necessarily refer to the aisle of boxed breakfast cereals in your local supermarket. \u201cCereals\u201d in these studies referred to the seeds of minimally refined whole grains that include the germ, bran, and endosperm. Examples are steel-cut oats, quinoa, brown rice, millet, barley, and buckwheat.\nA higher fiber intake has also been linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, a combination of factors that increases the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes: high blood pressure, high insulin levels, excess weight (especially around the belly), high triglyceride levels, and low HDL (good) cholesterol. [10,11]\n\n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes\nDiets low in fiber, especially insoluble types, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Large cohort studies of women found that a diet low in fiber (especially lacking cereal fibers) but containing foods with a high glycemic index (causing blood glucose surges) increased the risk of developing T2DM. [12,13] Other large cohorts of male and female health professionals have found that high-fiber whole grains (brown rice, rye, oats, wheat bran) are most strongly associated with lower diabetes risk. [14,15] Fibers from fruits and vegetables do not appear to have as strong an association. [16]\nRead about what you can do to help prevent type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast cancer\n\nA prospective cohort study of more than 90,000 premenopausal women found that a higher fiber intake as well as eating fiber during adolescence reduced breast cancer risk. When comparing the highest to lowest intakes of fiber, there was a 25% reduced risk of breast cancer. [32] This protection of dietary fiber on breast cancer risk was also found in a later meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies when comparing highest to lowest fiber intakes. It was found protective from both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers. [33]\nA high-fiber diet was also associated with a lower risk of benign breast disease, a risk factor in adolescents for the later development of breast cancer. [34]",

[33]\nA high-fiber diet was also associated with a lower risk of benign breast disease, a risk factor in adolescents for the later development of breast cancer. [34]\n\n\n\n\nColorectal cancer\nEarlier epidemiological studies show mixed results on the association of fiber and colorectal cancer (CRC). [27]\nOne reason may be due to differing effects of fiber on specific subtypes of CRC. When accounting for this, fiber was found to be protective with certain subtypes. [28] A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found fibers from fruits, vegetables, and legumes to offer some protection from CRC, but cereal fibers showed a stronger association with CRC prevention. [29] Other later meta-analyses have also found significant associations between a high-fiber diet and lower risk of CRC. [30,31]\n\n\n\n\nConstipation\nConstipation is generally defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week, difficulty or pain passing bowel movements, or small hard \u201cpebbly\u201d stool. Occasional bouts of constipation are common, but chronic constipation that does not resolve can lower quality of life and lead to symptoms of bloating, cramping, and even nausea. Chronic constipation increases the risk of diverticular disease and hemorrhoids.\nLifestyle behaviors that help relieve constipation include eating more fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; drinking more water; and regular exercise. There are various reasons why fiber reduces constipation. Some types of soluble fiber bind to water, creating a gel that helps to soften and bulk stool. Insoluble fibers mildly irritate the intestinal lining, which stimulates the secretion of water and mucus to encourage movement of stool. [26] Certain fibers act as prebiotics, or food for gut bacteria, which ferments fibers into short chain fatty acids and increases water in the intestines to produce softer, easier-to-pass stools. [26]\nBecause of the differing actions of various fiber types with constipation, a range of high-fiber foods from whole grains, fruits, legumes, and vegetables is recommended. It is suggested to increase fiber intake gradually, because a sudden significant increase in dietary fiber can cause bloating and cramping. Drinking more fluids while eating more fiber can also help lessen these side effects.",
        "1ff16885-481e-442a-ba61-68a021e1b4b2": "Diverticular disease\nDiverticulosis is a condition in which small \u201cpouches\u201d called diverticula develop in the lower intestine. It is one of the most common disorders of the colon in the Western world, with the highest rates in the U.S. and Europe. [17] The risk of developing diverticulosis increases with age (more than half of people over age 60 have diverticula) and is usually silent, not causing noticeable symptoms unless the pouches tear or become inflamed, leading to diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause persistent abdominal pain (usually in the lower left side), nausea, vomiting, and fever. Treatment is typically a brief period of no food, drinking liquids only, and antibiotic medications. In severe cases where an abscess or perforation may develop, surgery may be needed. However, most people who develop diverticulosis will not develop diverticulitis, with more recent studies estimating only 5% progressing to diverticulitis. [18]\nResearch shows that a Westernized diet low in fiber and high in red meat and ultra-processed refined foods is a major contributor. [19-21] An eating pattern such as this can lead to constipation, which over time weakens the colon muscles while increasing pressure when trying to defecate; small pouches can form within these weak spots. It can also lead to an increase in harmful intestinal bacteria, causing inflammation and further increasing the risk of diverticular disease. [17,20]\nLarge cohort studies show a protective effect of fiber on diverticular disease, particularly fibers from fruits, cereal grains, and vegetables. [22,23] A cohort of more than 43,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a protective effect of dietary fiber from diverticulitis, especially cellulose, a type of insoluble fiber. [24] Cellulose is found in the skins of fruits, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, legumes, and wheat bran. A Nurses\u2019 Health Study following more than 50,000 women found that those with the highest fiber intakes (25 or more grams daily) had a 13% lower risk of diverticulitis than those who ate the least (less than 18 grams daily). [2] The protective effect came especially from fibers from cereal grains and whole fruits, but not fruit juices.\nOther factors that increase the risk of diverticular disease are increasing age, smoking, lack of exercise, use of certain medications (NSAIDs, steroids, aspirin, opioids), family history, and history of irritable bowel syndrome. [18]",
        "e3ab9c75-c5be-4fcb-bb9c-7f8bca2fa962": "Should I avoid nuts and seeds with diverticulosis?If you have diverticulosis, chances are you\u2019ve heard that maybe you should avoid certain foods with small hard-to-digest particles: nuts, seeds, popcorn, corn, and fruits and vegetables with seeds like raspberries, strawberries, cucumber, or tomatoes. The reasoning is that these small undigested food particles might become trapped in the diverticular pouches and become inflamed from bacterial infection, causing the uncomfortable condition called diverticulitis. People who have experienced intense symptoms of diverticulitis often change their diets to avoid these foods in hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, evidence has shown this practice to be more of an urban legend than helping to reduce recurrences, and can deter people from eating foods that may actually help their condition in the future.\nAlthough the role of diet with diverticular disease has long been debated, a high-fiber intake with a focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables has been found to have a strong association with decreased risk of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. [18] When it comes to nuts and popcorn, research following more than 47,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study actually found a lower risk of diverticulitis when eating these foods. [25] Including these foods also did not increase the risk of developing new diverticulosis or diverticular complications.\n\n\u00a0\nBottom Line\nThere are many types of dietary fibers that come from a range of plant foods. It\u2019s important to not hyperfocus on a particular fiber because of its specific proposed action, as each type offers some level of health benefit. Therefore, eating a wide variety of plant foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to reach the fiber recommendation of 25-35 grams daily best ensures reaping those benefits.\nSome tips for increasing fiber intake:\n\nEat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices.\nReplace white rice, bread, and pasta with minimally processed brown rice and other whole grains like barley, millet, amaranth, farro, and\nAdd high-fiber foods to current meals: 1-2 tablespoons of almonds, ground flaxseeds, or chia seeds to cereals; diced vegetables to casseroles, stir-fried dishes, and soups.\nFor breakfast, choose cereals that have a whole grain as their first ingredient. Another tip is to look on the Nutrition Facts label and choose cereals with 20% or higher of the Daily Value (DV) for fiber.\nSnack on crunchy raw vegetables or a handful of almonds instead of chips and crackers.\nSubstitute beans or legumes for meat two to three times a week in chili and soups.\nIf it is difficult to eat enough fiber through food, a fiber supplement such as psyllium or methylcellulose powders or wafers can be used. They can help bulk and soften stool so it is easier to pass. However, fiber supplements are not intended to completely replace high-fiber foods.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInstitute of Medicine 2005.

That\u2019s why the Healthy Eating Pyramid says sugary drinks and sweets should be used sparingly, if at all, and the Healthy Eating Plate does not include foods with added sugars.\n4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoonKeep this tip in mind when reading nutrition labels to better visualize just how much added sugar the product contains. For example, one 12-ounce can of cola contains 39 grams\u2013almost 10 teaspoons of sugar!\n\nThe average American adult, teenager, and child consumes about 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, or about 270 calories. [1] While we sometimes add sugar or sweeteners like honey to food or beverages, most added sugar comes from processed and prepared foods.\u00a0The leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks like ice cream, pastries, and cookies. [1] Less obvious yet significant contributors are breakfast cereals and yogurt.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 advise that all Americans 2 years and older limit added sugars in the diet to less than 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie/day diet, that translates into 200 calories or 50 grams of sugar daily (about 12 teaspoons of sugar). Toddlers and infants younger than 2 years should not be given solids or beverages with any added sugars. [1]\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that Americans drastically cut back on added sugar to help slow the obesity and heart disease epidemics. [2]\n\nThe AHA suggests a stricter added-sugar limit of no more than 100 calories per day (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams) for most adult women and no more than 150 calories per day (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar) for most men.\nThe AHA also recommends a lower daily limit of added sugars for children ages 2-18 to less than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams per day, and sugary beverages should be limited to no more than 8 ounces a week. [3] For more info, visit Healthy kids \u2018sweet enough\u2019 without added sugars.\n\nSpotting sugar on a food labelSpotting added sugars in processed foods is easier since the rollout of the updated Nutrition Facts label. Previously, food and beverage manufacturers in the U.S. were required to list a product\u2019s total amount of sugar per serving on the label, but did not need to disclose how much of that was from added sugars versus naturally occurring. This was confusing for foods such as plain unsweetened milk or yogurt that listed 12 grams or more of \u201cSugars,\u201d but all of which was naturally occurring lactose sugar. Lactose does not impact blood glucose or carry the same health risks as white \u201ctable\u201d sugar and other caloric sweeteners.\nThe updated Nutrition Facts label now lists both \u201cTotal Sugars\u201d and underneath \u201cAdded Sugars.\u201d The percent Daily Value (DV) for added sugars is based on the recommended limit from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans of less than 50 grams a day (about 12 teaspoons) for an average 2,000 calorie diet. The percent DV will vary: a lower amount for a lower-calorie diet, and higher for a higher-calorie diet. The DV can be an easy way to compare food products for added sugars:\n\n5% DV or less of added sugars per serving is considered low\n20% DV or more of added sugars per serving is considered high\n\nIngredient list\n\nIngredients are listed in descending order by weight, so where sugar is listed in relation to other ingredients can indicate how much sugar a particular food contains.\nAdded sugars go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories.\n\nFood makers can also use sweeteners that aren\u2019t technically sugar\u2014a term which is applied only to table sugar, or sucrose\u2014but these other sweeteners are in fact forms of added sugar. Below are some other names for sugar that you may see on food labels:",
        "b83aa501-e211-4cb4-9f90-925df260e2cf": "Agave nectar\nDextrose\nMaltose\n\n\nBrown sugar\nEvaporated cane juice\nMalt syrup\n\n\nCane crystals\nFructose\nMaple syrup\n\n\nCane sugar\nFruit juice concentrates\nMolasses\n\n\nCoconut sugar\nGlucose\nRaw sugar\n\n\nCorn sweetener\nHigh-fructose corn syrup\nSucrose\n\n\nCorn syrup\nHoney\nSyrup\n\n\nCrystalline fructose\nInvert sugar\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Sources of Added Sugar\nSugary drinks\nSugary drinks are a prime source of extra calories that can contribute to weight gain and provide no nutritional benefits. Studies indicate that liquid carbohydrates such as sugar-sweetened beverages are less filling than solid food, causing people to continue to feel hungry after drinking them despite their high calories. [4] They are coming under scrutiny for their contributions to the development of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. [5]\n\nThe average 20-ounce bottle of sugar-sweetened soda, lemonade, or iced tea contains about 65 grams of added sugar, often from high-fructose corn syrup. That\u2019s the equivalent of 16 teaspoons of table sugar.\nIf you were to drink just one 12-ounce can of a sugar-sweetened soft drink every day, and not cut back on calories elsewhere, you could gain up to 15 pounds over three years. [6]\n\nBe careful to read serving sizes of bottled beverages. Many are sold in 20-ounce bottles, but what is considered one serving of that beverage may still vary among manufactures. For example, a popular cola drink may list the whole 20-ounce bottle as one serving containing 65 grams of added sugar. Another 20-ounce bottle of lemonade may seem a better choice, showing only 27 grams of added sugar per serving\u2014but the label states that one bottle contains 2.5 servings! Therefore, guzzling the whole bottle would give you almost 68 grams of sugar.\nTo reduce some confusion, the updated Nutrition Facts label mandates that manufacturers list serving sizes based on what people typically consume, rather than how much they should consume. The \u201ctypical\u201d beverage serving is now considered 12 ounces (increased from 8 ounces), so hopefully in the near future all beverage labels will list the same standard serving size.\nCereals and other foods\nChoosing minimally processed breakfast foods\u2014such as whole grain toast with nut butter, or a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned oatmeal\u2014that don\u2019t have lengthy ingredient lists is a great way to avoid added sugars. Unfortunately, many common breakfast foods such as ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, cereal bars, instant oatmeal with added flavoring, and pastries can contain high amounts of added sugars.\nSome ingredient lists mask the amount of sugar in a product. To avoid having \u201csugar\u201d as the first ingredient, food manufacturers may use multiple forms of sugar\u2014each with a different name\u2014and list each one individually on the nutrient label. But don\u2019t be fooled; your body metabolizes all added sugars the same way as it doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cbrown sugar,\u201d \u201cmolasses,\u201d \u201choney,\u201d and other caloric sweeteners. When reading a label, make sure to spot all sources of added sugars even if they\u2019re not listed as the first few ingredients.\nAlso be careful of foods that wear a \u201chealth halo.\u201d For example, one popular cereal advertises that it contains whole grains, fiber, and several antioxidant vitamins like C, E, and beta-carotene. But it also contains 18 grams of added sugar (4.5 teaspoons) in just one small bowl. Keep in mind serving sizes as well. A crunchy granola bar may contain two bars per pack; just one provides 6 grams of added sugar but if the whole pack is eaten, that number doubles to 12 grams. So you can see how added sugars may add up quickly!\nBottom Line\nThe body does not need carbohydrates from added sugars to function. A good rule of thumb is to avoid products that have a lot of added sugar, including skipping foods that list \u201csugar\u201d as the first or second ingredient. However, the products may use a variety of sweeteners so be sure to scan the full ingredient list. Fortunately, the updated\u00a0Nutrition Facts label in the U.S. now features a separate line for \u201cadded sugar\u201d so it easier to know just how much is added versus naturally occurring.\nSome tips for reducing added sugar intake:\n\nChoose plain yogurt with no added sugar and stir in fresh or frozen fruit or unsweetened applesauce and a dash of cinnamon.\nChoose cereals with 5% of the Daily Value or less of added sugars and add sliced ripe banana or berries.",

However, the products may use a variety of sweeteners so be sure to scan the full ingredient list. Fortunately, the updated\u00a0Nutrition Facts label in the U.S. now features a separate line for \u201cadded sugar\u201d so it easier to know just how much is added versus naturally occurring.\nSome tips for reducing added sugar intake:\n\nChoose plain yogurt with no added sugar and stir in fresh or frozen fruit or unsweetened applesauce and a dash of cinnamon.\nChoose cereals with 5% of the Daily Value or less of added sugars and add sliced ripe banana or berries.\nChoose water, seltzer, herbal tea, coffee and other beverages with no added sugar. Add a slice of orange, lemon, lime, or cucumber for a subtle flavor boost.\nWhen a sweets craving hits, try one of these first: 1/4 cup of unsweetened dried fruit; 1 cup of ripe fresh fruit; or a 1-ounce square of 75% dark chocolate.\nWhen baking, reduce the amount of added sugar by 1/4-1/3 cup. Or reduce the sugar by substituting half the amount with unsweetened applesauce or mashed ripe banana; for example, instead of 1 cup of sugar, use \u00bd cup sugar and \u00bd cup mashed fruit.\nIf you choose to enjoy a favorite treat high in sugar, practice eating a smaller portion than usual. Enjoy it fully by chewing slowly and savoring it.\nYour taste buds can adjust to sweetness levels! As you consistently reduce your total sugar intake, you may notice your sweets cravings lessen or that certain foods now taste too sweet.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Achieving a healthy and sustainable food future is an urgent matter that depends on global collaborative efforts.\nWhat is sustainability, and what does it have to do with food?\n\u201cSustainability\u201d can be hard to define as it can mean different things based on the context in which it\u2019s discussed. However, the concept is much more than a trending buzzword. The most frequently quoted definition was put forth by the U.N.\u2019s Brundtland Commission on sustainable development in 1987: \u201cSustainable development [meets] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d [1]\nJeffrey D. Sachs, an expert on sustainable development and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, wrote: \u201cLike all living species, humanity depends on nature for food and water, materials for survival, and safety from dire environmental threats, such as epidemics and natural catastrophes. Yet for a species that depends on the beneficence of nature, or on what the scientists call \u2018environmental services,\u2019 we are doing a poor job of protecting the physical basis of our very survival!\u201d\u00a0[2]\nIndeed, sustainability encompasses the environment, economics, health, nutrition, and other related dimensions. This interconnectedness can be observed in the FAO\u2019s definition of sustainable diets:\nSustainable Diets are those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources.\u00a0[3]\nAs we refer to it here, sustainability means the enactment of practices that fulfill the needs of society while protecting the physical basis of our long-term survival, our environment. We cannot have a secure food supply unless that food supply is sustainable.\nWhy is a sustainable food supply important?\nToday, more than three billion people are malnourished and many of our planet\u2019s 7 billion inhabitants eat diets low in quality. At the same time, the world\u2019s population is rapidly expanding, and it is estimated there will be close to 10 billion people on our planet by 2050. [4] \u00a0When considering sustainable food development, the goal is to ensure a future when this expanded population has both enough food available to eat and access to high quality, nutritious foods.\nThinking about a successful food future must focus on the earth system as a whole, rather than local levels. The \u201cAnthropocene\u201d is a term used to describe the current geological epoch, a time period defined by humanity being the dominating driver of change in atmospheric, geologic, hydrologic, biospheric and other earth systems. In other words, humanity\u2019s influence is at its greatest point in the history of our planet. The term \u201canthropogenic\u201d is an adjective that denotes \u201coriginating in human activity.\u201d\nIn terms of anthropogenic activities, agriculture is the largest cause of global environmental change. Examples of global environmental change include climate change, deforestation, desertification, and damage to coastal reefs and marine ecosystems.\n\nFood production:\n\nContributes approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the livestock sector alone represents almost half (14.5%) of these emissions [5, 6]\nOccupies about 40% of global land [7]\nUses 70% of freshwater [8]\nIs the largest factor threatening species with extinction [9]\nCauses eutrophication (nutrient overload) and dead zones in lakes and coastal areas [10]\nHas led to a majority (~60%) of the world fish stocks to be fully fished or overfished (33%) \u2013 only 7% are underfished [11]",
        "53afedfb-3646-4dde-a9d8-5d381a900cb9": "Such global environmental change increases the risk of irreversible and catastrophic shifts in the Earth system marked by rising human mortality, morbidity, conflict, and food insecurity. [12] \u00a0Agriculture in its current form is simultaneously a driver of global environmental change and a victim of shifting environmental conditions. [13] Without action, the world risks failing to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. Simply put: global food systems are not sustainable. We need to rethink how we eat and rethink the way we produce food in the process.\nHealthy diets from sustainable food systems\nDespite substantial scientific evidence linking diets with human health and environmental sustainability, historically there\u2019s been a lack of globally-agreed upon targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production. However, in 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission (a group of 37 scientists from 16 countries working in the fields of human health, nutrition, economics, agriculture, political sciences, and environmental sustainability) assessed existing evidence and developed global scientific targets that define a \u201csafe operating space\u201d for food systems. [14] These targets focus on two key areas that apply to all people and the planet:\nTarget 1: Healthy DietsBased on extensive research on foods, dietary patterns, and health outcomes, the Commission defines a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d with consumption ranges for each food group. Despite its name, this is not a specific diet but rather a flexible dietary pattern that largely consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils; includes a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry; and includes no or a low quantity of red meat, processed meat, added sugar, refined grains, and starchy vegetables. According to the Commission, global adoption of this pattern of eating would provide major health benefits, including a large reduction in total mortality.Learn more about the planetary health diet and how to put it into practice.\nTarget 2: Sustainable Food ProductionWith current food production driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and unsustainable changes in water and land use, the Commission also identifies a set of boundaries that global food production should stay within to \u201cdecrease the risk of irreversible and potentially catastrophic shifts in the Earth system.\u201d These boundaries relate to six key earth system processes: climate change (based on greenhouse gas emissions), land system change (based on cropland use), use of freshwater, biodiversity loss (based on extinction rate), and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling (based on the application of these fertilizers).\nA \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d is necessary\nTransitioning to a sustainable food system that can deliver healthy diets for an estimated 10 billion people by 2050 is an unprecedented challenge. However, the Commission emphasizes that \u201cdata are both sufficient and strong enough to warrant immediate action, and delay will increase the likelihood of serious, even disastrous, consequences.\u201d\nFortunately, their analysis found this transition would be doable through a combination of substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns, dramatic reductions in food losses and waste, and major improvements in food production practices. Of course, such a \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d will not happen without widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action guided by scientific targets. \u00a0To begin this process, the Commission proposes five strategies as general starting points for national, regional, city, and local change:\n\nSeek international and national commitment to shift toward healthy diets. Transitioning to a planetary health diet will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes must double. Policies are needed to improve the availability, access, and affordability of healthy foods while disincentivizing the consumption\u00a0of unhealthy and unsustainable foods.\nReorient agricultural priorities from producing high quantities of food to producing healthy food. Shift the emphasis in food and agricultural policy from high volumes of a few crops to greater diversity of nutrient-rich crops.\nSustainably intensify food production to increase high-quality output. Use technology and system innovation to farm existing land with fewer inputs in order to experience better yields, sequester carbon, and conserve existing biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans. Protect natural ecosystems and biodiversity by collectively acting, at local and global levels, to halt the expansion of agricultural land and harvested marine areas.\nAt least halve food losses and waste, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Reduce food loss and waste in food production and consumption phases by 50% using a mix of technological solutions, consumer campaigns, and public policies.\n\nFor more information and specifics on these strategies, read the Commission\u2019s full report, Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems.\u00a0Or, read the Commission\u2019s briefs for\u00a0cities, policymakers, farmers, food service professionals, healthcare professionals, and everyone.",

Chan School of Public Health explores how to avert dire consequences for human and planetary health through best practices and new technologies. Key questions were how to amplify nutritious food production, prevent waste and secure supplies, while protecting our environment in the process.\nView the recorded event\nThe bottom line\nAchieving a healthy and sustainable food system is an urgent matter that depends on collaborative efforts from governments, the private and public sectors, as well as individuals. Supply and demand work both ways\u2014a shift in the food production landscape depends on a shift in our diets. We must be aware that our food choices ultimately impact more than just ourselves, and primarily plant-based diets are best for both health outcomes and the environment. In the end, what\u2019s good for the planet is good for us too.\nRelated\n\nCenter for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard Chan C-CHANGE)\n\nFor stories of climate hope and action, subscribe to The Climate Optimist newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey terms for understanding sustainable food systems\n\nAnthropocene: A proposed new geological epoch which is characterized by humanity being the dominating force of change on the planet. The Anthropocene began in the mid-20th century and continues through today.\nPlanetary boundaries: Nine boundaries, each representing a system or process that is important for regulating and maintaining the stability of the planet. They define global biophysical limits that humanity should operate within to ensure a stable and resilient earth system\u2014ie, conditions that are necessary to foster prosperity for future generations.\nEarth system: Earth\u2019s interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes consisting of land, oceans, atmosphere, and poles, and includes earth\u2019s natural cycles\u2014 i.e., carbon, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other cycles. Life, including human society, is an integral part of the earth system and affects these natural cycles.\nBiodiversity: The diversity and richness of all living organisms on land and in water. Biodiversity contributes to the stability of ecosystems, enhances ecosystem services, and promotes the resilience of food production systems.\nBiosphere: All parts of the earth where life exists, including the lithosphere (solid surface layer), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The biosphere plays an important part in regulating the earth system by driving energy and nutrient flow between components.\nBoundaries: Thresholds set at the low end of the scientific uncertainty range that serve as guides for decision makers on acceptable levels of risk. Boundaries are baselines, unchanging, and not time-bound.\nDesertification: the process by which fertile land becomes desert, typically as a result of a drought, unsustainable agriculture, or land clearing.\nEutrophication: the process by which a body of water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients that stimulate growth of aquatic plant life usually resulting in the depletion of dissolved oxygen. In agriculture, this can result from fertilizer runoff, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, into water bodies.\nFood system: All elements and activities that relate to production, processing, distribution, preparation, and consumption of food.\nSafe operating space for food systems: A space that is defined by scientific targets for human health and environmentally sustainable food production set by the EAT-Lancet Commission. [14] Operating within this space allows humanity to feed healthy diets to about 10 billion people within biophysical limits of the earth system.\nGreat Food Transformation: The unprecedented range of actions taken by all food system sectors across all levels that aim to normalize healthy diets from sustainable food systems.\n\n(Adapted from: EAT, Summary Report of the EAT-Lancet Commission [15])",

Shifting towards a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d can nurture both people and planet.\nHuman diets inextricably link health and environmental sustainability, and have the potential to nurture both. [1] Increased food production over the past 50 years has helped improve life expectancy and reduce hunger, infant and child mortality rates, and global poverty. However, such benefits are now being offset by shifts towards unhealthy diets.\nGlobally, as nations have urbanized and citizen incomes have increased, traditional diets (typically higher in quality plant-based foods), have transitioned to a \u201cWestern-style dietary pattern,\u201d characterized by high consumption of calories, highly processed foods (refined carbohydrates, added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats), and high amounts of animal products. [2,3] Along with the negative human health impacts associated with this nutrition transition, this dietary pattern is also unsustainable. Current food production is already driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and drastic changes in land and water use.\nDifferent food, different impactAlong with varying impacts on human health, different foods also have differing impacts on the environment. As shown in the figure below, the production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions (orange bars) than producing plant-based foods\u2014and dairy and red meat (especially beef) stand out for their disproportionate impact. Beyond emissions, it\u2019s also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination (in this figure, these impacts are represented by land use [green bars] and freshwater consumption [blue bars]).\n\n(Source: World Resources Institute. [4] Details about the data used to produce this figure available here.)\n\n Foodprint calculator Want to know the environmental impact of your diet? Take this quick five minute survey to find your carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints! \nTransitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems\u2014especially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050\u2014poses an unprecedented challenge. However, research by an international working group of scientists shows this \u201cGreat Food Transformation\u201d could be achievable through a combination of dramatic reductions in food losses and waste, major improvements in food production practices, and substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns. [1]\nDefining a \u201cPlanetary Health Diet\u201d\nIn 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission developed the world\u2019s first scientific targets for healthy and sustainable food systems, including a \u201cplanetary health diet\u201d with defined daily consumption ranges for each food group. This dietary pattern\u2014characterized by a variety of high-quality plant-based foods and low amounts of animal-based foods, refined grains, added sugars, and unhealthy fats\u2014is designed to be flexible to accommodate local and individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences.\n\n\nScientific targets for a planetary health diet\n\n\n\nFood group\nIntake (possible ranges), grams/day\nCaloric intake, kcal/day (based on a 2,500 kcal/day diet)\n\n\nMajor carbohydrate sources \u2013 0-60% of energy\n\n\nWhole grains (such as rice, wheat, corn), dry\n232 grams (adjusted to meet energy target)\n811 kcal\n\n\nTubers or starchy vegetables (potatoes and cassava)\n50 (0-100) grams\n39 kcal\n\n\nProtein \u2013 around 15% of energy intake\n\n\nBeef and lamb\n7 (0-14) grams\n15 kcal\n\n\nPork\n7 (0-14) grams\n15 kcal\n\n\nChicken and other poultry\n29 (0-58) grams\n62 kcal\n\n\nEggs\n13 (0-25) grams\n19 kcal\n\n\nFish (including shellfish)\n28 (0-100) grams\n40 kcal",

Modeling studies show that between 10.9 to 11.6 million early deaths could be averted each year\u2014a 19% to 23.6% reduction from current adult mortality rates. [1]\nCompared with current diets, this shift will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes must double. That said, the Commission emphasizes the importance of tailoring these targets to local situations. For example, while North American countries currently consume almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, countries in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. [1]\nUndoubtedly, making such a radical shift to the global food system is unprecedented, and will depend on widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action. Alongside dramatic reductions in food waste and major improvements in food production practices, the Commission\u2019s report calls for \u201cinternational and national commitment\u201d through a range of policy measures and actions needed to make healthy and sustainable foods more available, accessible, and affordable. From governments and policymakers to marketers, industry, the media, educational institutions, farmers, chefs, physicians, and consumers\u2014everyone has an important role to play in this Great Food Transformation.\nPlant-forward for planetary healthThe term plant-forward is defined as \u201ca style of cooking and eating that emphasizes and celebrates, but is not limited to, foods from plant sources\u2014fruits and vegetables (produce), whole grains, legumes (pulses), nuts and seeds, plant oils, and herbs and spices\u2014and reflects evidence-based principles of health and sustainability.\u201d\nCreated through Menus of Change (a joint initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s\u00a0 Department of Nutrition), plant-forward describes a broad set of dietary patterns and approaches to menu design that deliver both personal and planetary health but also preserve a wide range of choices.\nlearn more about plant-forward approaches and trends\nPreparing a Planetary Health Plate\nIt\u2019s clear that what we put on our plates has a major impact on the environment. Eating more healthfully and more sustainably go hand-in-hand, meaning we can develop sustainable eating practices that improve our own health while also benefiting the health of the planet. If you\u2019re interested in practicing a planetary health diet, but confused by the specific targets in the table above, here are some tips that may help:\n\nFirst of all, be sure to note that these ranges are based on daily energy intake of 2,500 calories for an average adult. That means your individual optimal intake will depend on age, body size, and level of physical activity. (The Commission\u2019s report includes special considerations for young children, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.)\nThis dietary pattern is also intended to be flexible enough to accommodate individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences. Animal products are minimized, not completely excluded, so there is a range of options for omnivores as well as those who follow vegetarian or vegan diets.\nSeeing certain foods listed in grams per day may be unfamiliar. For example, how to eat only 13 grams of eggs per day when a single large egg is about 50 grams? You might be able to stick to this amount if you scramble a single egg into a stir-fry serving for multiple people, however it\u2019s easier to think about your egg consumption on a weekly basis, where this equates to around 2 eggs.\nThe same goes for other animal products. Eating even the upper-limit of 14 grams per day of red meat (a fraction of a single hamburger patty) may not be as realistic as thinking about saving this daily amount for one day during the week (e.g. eating one whole hamburger patty).\u00a0Aim to consume no more than 98 grams of red meat (pork, beef or lamb), 203 grams of poultry, and 196 grams of fish per week.\n\nUnderstandably, if you\u2019ve grown up (or have grown accustomed to) having beef, pork, and other red meats on your plate at most meals, such a change may seem daunting. But remember you don\u2019t have to completely cut it out to make a difference for your health and the health of the planet. If you\u2019re not quite sure where to start, here are four key approaches to cutting back the red meat while keeping your meals filling and flavorful.",

Reasons include losses from mold, pests, or inadequate climate control; losses from cooking; and intentional food waste. [1]\nThis waste is categorized differently based on where it occurs:\n\nFood \u201closs\u201d occurs before the food reaches the consumer as a result of issues in the production, storage, processing, and distribution phases.\nFood \u201cwaste\u201d refers to food that is fit for consumption but consciously discarded at the retail or consumption phases.\n\nWasted food has far-reaching effects, both nationally and globally. In the U.S., up to 40% of all food produced goes uneaten [2], and about 95% of discarded food ends up in landfills [3]. It is the largest component of municipal solid waste at 21%. [1] In 2014, more than 38 million tons of food waste was generated, with only 5% diverted from landfills and incinerators for composting. [3] Decomposing food waste produces methane, a strong greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Worldwide, one-third of food produced is thrown away uneaten, causing an increased burden on the environment. [4]\u00a0It is estimated that reducing food waste by 15% could feed more than 25 million Americans every year. [5]\nBenefits of Less Food Waste\n\nCost savings on labor through more efficient handling, preparation, and storage of food that will be used.\nCost savings when purchasing only as much food as needed, and avoiding additional costs of disposal.\nReduced methane emissions from landfills and a lower carbon footprint.\nBetter management of energy and resources, preventing pollution involved in the growing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling of food.\nCommunity benefits by providing donated, untouched, and safe food that would otherwise be thrown out. [6]\n\nProposed Solutions to Food Waste\nGlobally, reducing wasted food has been cited as a key initiative in achieving a sustainable food future. Sustainable Development Goal 12 addresses responsible consumption and production, which includes two indicators to measure (in order to ultimately reduce) global food loss and food waste. [7]\nIn the U.S, on June 4, 2013, the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, calling on entities across the food chain, including farms, agricultural processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, universities, schools, and local governments. [1] The goals are to:\n\nReduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.",

[1] The goals are to:\n\nReduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.\nRecover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger relief organizations like food banks and pantries.\nRecycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy, and natural fertilizers.\n\nOn September 16, 2015, both agencies also announced for the first time a national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 to improve overall food security and conserve natural resources.\nThe National Resources Defense Council issued a summary paper providing guidelines on how to reduce waste throughout the food production chain. [2] The following are some focal points:\n\nState and local governments can incorporate food waste prevention and education campaigns, and implement municipal composting programs. Governments can provide tax credits to farmers who donate excess produce to local food banks. Proposed bills are currently in place in California, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado.\nBusinesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services can evaluate the extent of their food waste and adopt best practices. Examples include supermarkets selling damaged or nearly expired produce at discounted prices, or offering \u201chalf-off\u201d promotions instead of \u201cbuy-one-get-one-free\u201d promotions. Restaurants can offer smaller portions and donate excess ingredients and prepared uneaten food to charities. Schools may experiment with concepts that allow children to create their own meals to prevent less discarded food, such as with salad bars or build-your-own burritos.\nFarms can evaluate food losses during processing, distribution, and storage and adopt best practices. Farmers markets can sell \u201cugly\u201d produce, which are discarded, misshapen fruits and vegetables that do not meet the usual standards for appearance. Farms can sell fresh but unmarketable produce (due to appearance) to food banks at a reduced rate.\nConsumers can learn when food is no longer safe and edible, how to cook and store food properly, and how to compost.

[8] From the most preferred at the top of the pyramid to the least preferred at the bottom tip, the methods include:\n\nSource reduction: Earliest prevention by reducing the overall volume of food produced\nFeed hungry people: Donating excess food to community sites\nFeed animals: Donating food scraps and waste to local farmers who can use them for animal feed\nIndustrial uses: Donating used fats, oils, and grease to make biodiesel fuel\nComposting: Food waste that is composted to produce organic matter that is used to fertilize soil\nLandfill/Incineration: A last resort for unused food\n\nRead Next:\u00a0Tackling Food Waste at Home \u00bb\nRelated\n\nReducing meal waste in schools: A healthy solution\nSustainability\nThe Food Law and Policy Clinic of Harvard Law School",

Although healthy weight guidelines have been developed at population levels, each person\u2019s healthy weight range will vary and depend on factors such as age, sex, genetics, body frame, existing medical history, lifestyle habits, and weight as a young adult. Weight is only one of many determinants of health. Body mass index (BMI), which measures weight standardized for height, is often used as a measure of health risk. Although it does not measure body fat or body composition directly, research has shown BMI to correlate closely with other methods that directly measure body fat.\n\n\nHow useful are the MET Life Height-Weight Tables?\nThe Metropolitan Life Height-Weight tables were created by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1943 to estimate longevity using height and weight data from 4 million policy holders. [1,2] They were intended to be a simple tool showing \u201cideal\u201d weight ranges that were associated with the lowest rates of early death. People from the ages of 25 to 59 whose weights fell within the listed ranges for sex (men or women), frame (small, medium, or large), and height were found to have the lowest mortality rates. These weight tables were often used to determine target weights Since then, the tables have been revised twice, changing the term \u201cideal\u201d to \u201cdesirable\u201d weight, and finally simply \u201cheight to weight\u201d tables. Though some health professionals and the general public still refer to the tables today as a guideline for optimal weight ranges, there are many criticisms about the tables such as not accounting for body composition (e.g., fat vs. muscle mass), data limited to mainly Caucasian Americans, and lack of information on causes of mortality (e.g., certain conditions like cancer that may cause a lower body weight).",
        "0dd9368d-4b7b-441b-bbf2-68db12faead7": "There are many reasons for weight gain including certain medications (corticosteroids, antidepressants, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, insulin), pregnancy, chronic stress, chronically poor sleep, an excessive calorie intake, and lack of adequate exercise. [3,4]\nIt is beneficial to keep a steady weight as much as possible and control excessive weight gain over time, which is strongly associated with health risks.\nMaintain, Don\u2019t Gain\nMaintaining a healthy weight can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure, and many different cancers. [5]\nYour weight, waist size, and the amount of weight gained since your mid-20s can have health implications. These factors may strongly influence your chances of developing the following diseases and conditions:\n\nCardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke\nDiabetes\nCancer\nArthritis\nGallstones\nAsthma\nCataracts\nInfertility\nSnoring\nSleep apnea\n\nMost adults gain on average 1-2 pounds each year. [6] Gaining weight as you age increases the chances of developing one or more chronic diseases.\n\nIn the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer. [7-11] Those who gained more than 22 pounds had an even larger risk of developing these diseases.\nAnother analysis of Nurses\u2019 Health Study data found that adult weight gain can increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, even after menopause. [12] Encouragingly, for women who had never used hormone replacement therapy, losing weight after menopause\u2014and keeping it off\u2014cut their risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in half.\n\n\n\nDoes having overweight reduce mortality?\nSome studies have suggested that having overweight and obesity is associated with lower mortality than having normal weight. [13,14] But these findings may be explained by several methodological flaws:\n\nThe main flaw in a systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic [14] was that the normal weight group, which showed an increased mortality risk compared to the overweight group, included more heavy smokers, patients with cancer or other diseases that cause weight loss, and elderly people suffering from frailty. There was no distinction made between these unhealthy normal weight people and lean healthy individuals. The groups with overweight and obesity did appear to have a lower mortality rate than this mix of healthy and very unhealthy normal-weighted individuals, and this flaw led to false conclusions that overweight and obesity carry no risk and may offer reduced mortality.\nOther large studies that accounted for this and other methodological issues have found that having overweight and obesity is associated with increased risk of mortality compared with having a normal weight. [15]\n\n\n\nWhat Causes Weight Gain?\n\nDiet. The quantity and quality of food in your diet has a strong impact on weight.\nGenes. Some people are genetically predisposed to gain weight more easily than others or to store fat around the midsection. Genes do not have to become destiny, however, and studies suggest that eating a healthy diet, staying active, and avoiding unhealthy habits like drinking soda can prevent the genetic predisposition to risk for obesity. [16] Read more about genetic risk for obesity on the Obesity Prevention Source.\nPhysical inactivity. Exercise has a host of health benefits, including reducing the chances of developing heart disease, some types of cancer, and other chronic diseases. [17] Physical activity is a key element of weight control and health.\nStress. Chronic stress can lead to unhealthy eating habits, such as elevated cortisol levels causing cravings for \u201ccomfort\u201d foods of highly processed snacks or sweets, having lower motivation to prepare balanced meals or even forgetting to eat, and disrupting sleep that can lead to higher intakes of caffeine or high-calorie sugary snacks to boost energy.\nInadequate sleep. Research suggests that there\u2019s a link between how much people sleep and how much they weigh. In general, children and adults who get too little sleep tend to weigh more than those who get enough sleep. [18,19]\n\nThe influence of our environmentsAs important as individual choices are when it comes to health, no one person behaves in a vacuum. The physical and social environment in which people live plays a huge role in the food and activity choices they make. And unfortunately, in the U.S. and increasingly around the globe, our environments are not optimized for healthy living. From the persistent marketing and availability of unhealthy foods and sugary drinks, to time and safety constraints for staying active, individuals are faced with a variety of challenges. Obesity and its causes have, in many ways, become woven into the fabric of our society.",

Obesity and its causes have, in many ways, become woven into the fabric of our society. To successfully disentangle them will take a multifaceted approach that not only gives people the skills to make healthier choices but also sets in place policy and infrastructure that support those choices.\n\nBenefits of Even Modest Weight Loss\nIf you have gained more than 25 pounds in adulthood, losing that weight may seem daunting. And when the extra weight doesn\u2019t feel good, you may be tempted to start a drastic weight loss plan. But the good news is that even a modest weight loss of 5% of your current body weight is likely to produce several health benefits, including improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood sugars, physical mobility, and quality of life. [20,21]\nTips to lose weight safely: \n\nKeep it slow and steady. People who lose weight gradually and steadily (about 1 to 2 pounds per week) are more successful at keeping weight off. [20] This allows the body to adjust to the change and can lower the risk of developing strong cravings and feelings of deprivation that often accompany more rapid weight loss.\nInclude self-management and monitoring. This includes setting goals such as with the SMART acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Start by creating 2-3 short-term SMART goals. Self-monitoring such as with daily or weekly food journaling or using behavior apps can provide insight and accountability to eating behaviors. This category also includes problem solving, such as having a plan for \u201crelapses\u201d if weight is regained due to stressful life changes, holidays, or job demands. [6]\nCreate a support system. Research suggests that having frequent contact with others for support (e.g., trusted family member or friend, physician, health coach, registered dietitian, or a fellow friend or coworker on a similar healthy weight journey) can be valuable in providing encouragement and accountability. [6]\nDevelop healthy eating patterns. Although some researchers have questioned the usefulness of energy balance (calories eaten versus calories expended), current evidence indicates that calorie reduction remains the most effective approach for weight control. There are many dietary strategies (e.g., high-carb low-fat vs. low-carb high-fat vs. intermittent fasting vs. a Mediterranean diet), but research has not consistently shown greater weight loss with one plan over another in the long-term. The Healthy Eating Plate model that provides balanced nutrition and portion control is a good place to start.\nPractice mindfulness. Do you eat too fast or while distracted watching television or scrolling through your phone? Do you stress-eat or snack even when not hungry? Mindful eating addresses these behaviors that are associated with weight gain. Increasing awareness and appreciation of food can provide greater satisfaction, physically and mentally, that may help reduce overeating.\nStay active. Exercise is one component in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight gain, but it also plays a key role in wellbeing and mental health. The National Weight Control Registry, which follows people who have lost and maintained a 30-pound loss for at least one year, shows that participants include about one hour of moderate-vigorous exercise daily such as brisk walking. However there is variation among participants, with some requiring more exercise and some less to keep the weight off. How much is needed will depend on one\u2019s genes and lifestyle factors. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further.\nPrioritize self-care. In a rushed society with never-ending demands, taking care of our bodies can quickly fall to the bottom of our priority list. Dedicating time to care for one\u2019s emotional, physical, and spiritual needs can promote a healthy weight. Many of the factors listed above are examples of self-care; others could be discovering a new hobby, practicing daily meditation, or allowing time to just do nothing. Self-care may help improve mood and a sense of wellbeing, and increase motivation and energy levels.",

Self-care may help improve mood and a sense of wellbeing, and increase motivation and energy levels. It also cultivates self-compassion and resilience, as one learns to accept their mistakes and move on.\n\nShould I try a health and nutrition app?Smartphone or mobile health apps are self-monitoring easily-accessible tools people can use to track their weight and dietary intake. Self-monitoring is closely associated with self-efficacy, defined as a person having confidence in their ability to improve one\u2019s health by changing behaviors. [22] People can use these apps to assess their nutritional intake by logging specific foods and eating patterns. Apps may provide a food database from which to search, a photo function to take pictures of meals, a scanning tool to find food products using barcodes, or food icons. Other apps monitor eating behaviors such as stress-related or emotional eating, eating quickly or on-the-run, and overeating. A major benefit of these tools is increased awareness of types of foods eaten and eating behaviors that could be contributing to weight gain or changes in metabolic parameters such as high blood glucose or cholesterol.\nThe number of health-related apps targeting behavior change has boomed, with more than 325,000 apps commercially available in 2017. [22] Health apps are often low-cost or free, and can be effective at-home monitoring tools that complement traditional care such as in-person visits to a doctor or dietitian. For example, if a healthcare provider advises a patient to lose weight to improve a chronic health condition, a nutritional app can provide tracking, accountability, and interaction that engages the patient until the next healthcare provider visit.\nThis may be especially useful for certain groups; one study found that rural men were more likely to successfully use health apps for weight loss/nutrition programs than to participate in face-to-face programs, due to cultural norms of self-reliance. [23] Meta-analyses show that people who use apps can experience greater weight loss, decreased waist circumference, and lower calorie intake compared with controls, in the short-term. [24,25] Other studies have shown benefits in improving nutrition behaviors, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. [25] However, there are limitations to these meta-analyses that made comparisons difficult: the studies used different commercial apps with varying functions, and participants used the apps at varying levels (e.g., daily versus weekly). Also, most of the studies were of short duration at less than 6 months. [22,25] Generally the more often the app was used, the greater adherence there was to nutritional goals and achieving weight loss. [26] Unfortunately many of the studies suggested that app use generally declined over time. Still, health apps are worth a try for anyone starting a healthy lifestyle plan and for those who might not have easy access to other support systems.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKomaroff M.

But fat is an important source of stored energy when we can\u2019t get to food for an extended time. Within the matrix of body fat, also called adipose tissue, there is not only fat cells but nerve and immune cells and connective tissue. [2] Fat tissue releases hormones that control metabolism and appetite (i.e., leptin, adiponectin) and that affect insulin sensitivity (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6). Macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils are some of the immune cells found in fat tissue that play a role in inflammation\u2014both anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory. Fat cells also secrete proteins and build enzymes involved with immune function and the creation of steroid hormones.\nFat cells can grow in size and number. The amount of fat cells in our bodies is determined soon after birth and during adolescence, and tends to be stable throughout adulthood if weight remains fairly stable. [3] But eating too many calories in the long-term can cause fat cells to increase in size and be stored in various areas throughout the body, which leads to a risk of chronic inflammation and glitches in healthy metabolism, with the potential for new fat cells to grow. These larger fat cells become resistant to insulin, which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Weight loss can reduce the size of fat cells but not the number.\nObesity, defined as an excessive amount of body fat, is a common and expensive medical condition in the U.S., strongly associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, as well as premature deaths from these diseases. [1] Learning about the actions and different types of body fat may increase understanding of this condition.\nTypes of Body Fat\nFat tissue comes in white, brown, beige, and even pink. [2] Some are necessary for good health.\nTypes\n\nBrown fat \u2013 Infants carry the most brown fat, which keeps them warm. It is stimulated by cold temperatures to generate heat. The amount of brown fat does not change with increased calorie intake, and those who have overweight or obesity tend to carry less brown fat than lean persons.\nWhite fat \u2013 These large round cells are the most abundant type and are designed for fat storage, accumulating in the belly, thighs, and hips. They secrete more than 50 types of hormones, enzymes, and growth factors including leptin and adiponectin, which helps the liver and muscles respond better to insulin (a blood sugar regulator).",

They secrete more than 50 types of hormones, enzymes, and growth factors including leptin and adiponectin, which helps the liver and muscles respond better to insulin (a blood sugar regulator). But if there are excessive white cells, these hormones are disrupted and can cause the opposite effect of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation.\nBeige fat \u2013 This type of white fat can be converted to perform similar traits as brown fat, such as being able to generate heat with exposure to cold temperatures or during exercise.\nPink fat \u2013 This type of white fat is converted to pink during pregnancy and lactation, producing and secreting breast milk.\nEssential fat \u2013 This type may be made up of brown, white, or beige fat and is vital for the body to function normally. It is found in most organs, muscles, and the central nervous system including the brain. It helps to regulate hormones like estrogen, insulin, cortisol, and leptin; control body temperature; and assist in the absorption of vitamins and minerals. When a person\u2019s body fat dips below a certain level (about less than 5% in men and less than 10% in women), there may not be enough essential fat to perform these functions.\n\nLocation\n\nSubcutaneous \u2013 You can pinch this layer of fat that sits directly underneath the skin\u2019s surface, cushioning the bones and joints. It\u2019s the body\u2019s most abundant type of fat and tends to accumulate around the waist, hips, upper back, buttocks, and thighs. Very high amounts of subcutaneous fat can increase the risk of disease, though not as significantly as visceral fat.\u00a0\nVisceral \u2013 An excess of this type of white fat is sometimes referred to as \u201cbelly fat\u201d or \u201ccentral obesity,\u201d as it accumulates deep in the abdominal cavity, wrapping around digestive organs like the pancreas, intestines, and liver but also the heart. Having a lot of visceral fat is linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. It may secrete inflammatory chemicals called cytokines that promote insulin resistance.\n\nHow do I get rid of belly fat?It\u2019s a popular question by both men and women. Unfortunately, doing extra sit-ups or drinking apple cider vinegar won\u2019t help spot-tone this stubborn area. Losing weight can help, though people tend to lose weight pretty uniformly throughout the body rather than in one place. However, a long-term commitment to following exercise guidelines along with eating balanced portion-controlled meals can help to reduce dangerous visceral fat. Also effective is avoiding sugary beverages that are strongly associated with excessive weight gain in children and adults. And don\u2019t discount other lifestyle factors such as poor sleep and elevated cortisol levels from chronic stress that are both strongly associated with increased belly fat and weight gain. Learn more about maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nMeasuring Body Fat\nObesity, or body fatness, is calculated with various methods that range in accuracy and have limitations. Combining two or more methods, if possible, may better predict if someone has increased health risks related to weight.\nBody Mass Index (BMI)\nOne of the most widely used tools for estimating excess fat is the body mass index (BMI). BMI only measures excess weight, calculating a ratio of one\u2019s weight to height. [4] However, research has shown that BMI often correlates with \u201cgold standard\u201d direct measures of fat mass and fat-free mass such as underwater weighing (hydrostatic weighing) and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). In comparison with these methods that require expensive equipment, BMI is noninvasive, easy to calculate, and can be used anywhere.\nBecause of its simplicity and widespread use, BMI is often used when studying populations. Researchers can compare the BMI of groups of people over time in different areas, to screen for obesity and its related health risks.\nBMI does have several limitations. It can\u2019t measure location of fat (e.g., belly fat is linked with greater health risks), muscle mass, or bone mass\u2014all of which contribute to weight. One\u2019s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI.",

One\u2019s age, sex, race, and ethnicity can also affect BMI. [4] For example, when comparing two people with the same BMI:\n\nWomen genetically have more body fat and less muscle mass than men.\nHighly trained athletes may have a high BMI from increased muscle mass but little body fat.\nOlder adults tend to carry more body fat than younger adults.\nWhile BMI and weight tend to decline in the elderly, visceral abdominal fat may continue to increase. [5]\nMen and women with larger body frames may have a higher weight from greater (heavier) bone mass rather than fat mass.\nSome studies have found that Black individuals have less body fat and more lean muscle than other ethnicities at the same BMI. However, Blacks and Hispanics have the highest rates of obesity in the U.S., so the overall burden of obesity-related diseases is still higher in these groups.\n\nFor these reasons, BMI might be used as a screening tool for potential weight-related problems rather than to diagnose certain conditions. The accuracy of BMI in predicting health risk may vary across different individuals and racial and ethnic groups. \u00a0Some populations have higher rates of obesity but that do not have corresponding rates of metabolic diseases like diabetes, and vice versa. [3] For instance, Southeast Asians can have a normal BMI but be metabolically unhealthy.\nBMI might be supplemented with other measures such as waist circumference or waist-hip ratio that better assess fat distribution.\nHow to determine BMI\n\nDivide your weight in pounds by your height in inches.\nDivide the answer by your height in inches.\nMultiply the answer by 703.\n\nYou can also use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\u2019s online BMI calculator or simple BMI tables.\nInterpreting the BMI number\n\nThe World Health Organization defines a \u201cnormal\u201d weight as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, \u201coverweight or pre-obesity\u201d as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, and \u201cobesity\u201d as a BMI of 30 or higher. It further classifies levels of obesity as Class I (BMI 30.0 to 34.9), Class II (BMI 35.0 to 39.9), and Class III (BMI 40 or higher). (6)\nAt a population level, a high BMI is generally associated with an increased risk of disease and early death. Many studies have shown that a BMI above 25 increases the chances of dying early compared to those with normal weight:\n\nA meta-analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a clear relationship between BMI and mortality, where both people with underweight (BMI <18.5) and with overweight and obesity (BMI >25) had greater mortality. [7] The lowest death rate from any cause was associated with the BMI range between 22.5 and 24.9. To address some methodological flaws in previous studies, this study excluded smokers who tend to have lower weight due to smoking, individuals with cancer and heart disease who might have lost weight due to these conditions, and individuals over the age of 85 who could have a normal BMI but suffer from frailty or other age-related unhealthy weight loss.\nAnother large meta-analysis in The Lancet that looked at data across four continents found that for every five units higher of a BMI above 25, risk of premature death increased by about 31%. [8] The study also looked at specific causes of death, and found that for each 5-unit increase in BMI above 25, the corresponding increases in risk were 49% for cardiovascular mortality, 38% for respiratory disease mortality, and 19% for cancer mortality. This meta-analysis also excluded participants who were current or former smokers, those who had chronic diseases at the beginning of the study, and any who died in the first five years of follow-up (a combined 1.6 million deaths were recorded across these studies where participants were followed for an average of 14 years).",

Experts say these methodological flaws have led to paradoxical, misleading results that suggest a survival advantage to being overweight.\n\nWaist Circumference\nSome researchers consider waist circumference to be a better measure of unhealthy body fat than BMI as it addresses visceral abdominal fat, which is associated with metabolic problems, inflammation, and insulin resistance. [3,9] It is a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality, and provides a clearer picture of health, as abdominal fat can increase even if total weight remains the same. An increasing waist size can be an important \u201cwarning sign\u201d that prompts a closer look at potentially unhealthy lifestyle habits. In people who do not have overweight, increasing waist size over time may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI alone. [5,10]\n\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study looked at the relationship between waist size and death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause in middle-aged women. [10] At the start of the study, more than 44,000 healthy volunteers measured their waist and hip sizes. After 16 years, women who reported the highest waist sizes\u201435 inches or larger\u2014had nearly double the risk of dying from heart disease, compared with women who reported the lowest waist sizes (<28 inches). Women in the group with the largest waists had a similarly high risk of death from cancer or any cause, compared with women with the smallest waists. The risks increased steadily with each additional inch around the waist. Yet even women with a \u201cnormal weight\u201d (BMI <25) were at higher risk, if they carried more of that weight around their waist. Normal-weight women with a waist of 35 inches or higher had three times the risk of death from heart disease, compared with normal-weight women whose waists were smaller than 35 inches.\nThe Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study found a similar relationship between increasing waist size and risk of death from any cause in normal-weight women. [11]\n\nHow to measure and interpret waist size\nWear thin clothing or no clothing. Stand up straight and wrap a flexible measuring tape around your midsection, laying the tape flat so it crosses your navel (belly button). The tape should be snug but not pinched too tightly around the waist. Inhale and exhale regularly, and then read the measurement (in other words, don\u2019t inhale deeply and hold your breath while measuring!). You can repeat the measurement 2-3 times to ensure a consistent reading. According to an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health, a waist size larger than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women increases the chances of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic diseases. [12,13]\n\nWaist-to-Hip Ratio\nLike the waist circumference, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is used to measure abdominal obesity. It\u2019s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement. It is inexpensive and simple to use, and a good predictor of disease risk and early mortality. Some believe that WHR may be a better indicator of risk than waist circumference alone, as waist size can vary based on body frame size, but a large study found that waist circumference and WHR were equally effective at predicting risk of death from heart disease, cancer, or any cause. [10]\nStill, WHR can be more complex to interpret than waist circumference, since a higher WHR reading can be caused by excess abdominal fat and/or decreased lean muscle mass around the hips. The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity.",
        "e631d5df-5bc4-48d6-bb56-0eed7adcf101": "It\u2019s calculated by measuring the waist and the hip (at the widest diameter of the buttocks), and then dividing the waist by the hip measurement.

The World Health Organization has also found that cut-off points that define health risks may vary by ethnicity. For example, Asians appear to show higher metabolic risk when carrying higher body fat at a lower BMI; therefore the cut-off value for a healthy WHR in Asian women is 0.80 or less, compared with 0.85 or less in Caucasian women. [14]\nHow to measure and interpret WHR\nStand up straight and follow the directions for measuring waist circumference. Then wrap the tape measure around the widest part of the buttocks. Divide the waist size by the hip size. The WHO defines abdominal obesity in men as a WHR more than 0.90; for women, more than 0.85. [14]\n\nWaist-to-Height Ratio\nWaist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is a simple, inexpensive screening tool that measures visceral abdominal fat. It has been supported by research to predict cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, and early death, even when BMI falls within a healthy range. [15,16] When the waist circumference is less than half one\u2019s height, it is considered lower risk.\u00a0\nTo determine WHtR, divide waist circumference in inches by height in inches. A measurement of 0.5 or higher is an indicator of health risks related to visceral obesity.\n\nAdditional Measures of Body Fat\nAlthough less commonly used, here are some other methods for measuring body fat.\n\n\nSkinfold Thickness\nA caliper measures the thickness of a \u201cpinch\u201d of skin and the fat beneath it in specific areas of the body (torso, thighs, front and back of the upper arm, and under the shoulder blade). Equations are used to predict body fat percentage based on these measurements. It is inexpensive and convenient, but accuracy depends on the skill and training of the measurer. At least three measurements are needed from different body parts. The calipers have a limited range and therefore may not accurately measure persons with obesity or those whose skinfold thickness exceeds the width of the caliper. \n\n\n\n\nBioelectric Impedance (BIA)\nBIA equipment sends a small, imperceptible, safe electric current through the body, measuring the resistance. The current faces more resistance passing through body fat than it does passing through lean body mass and water. Equations are used to estimate body fat percentage and fat-free mass. [17] The devices are convenient, portable, and relatively inexpensive but the ratio of body water to fat can change during illness, dehydration, or weight loss, decreasing its accuracy. Readings may also not be as accurate in individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.\n\n\n\n\nUnderwater Weighing (Densitometry or Hydrostatic Weighing)\nIndividuals are weighed on dry land and then again while submerged in a water tank. [17] Researchers use formulas to estimate body volume, body density, and body fat percentage. Fat \u201cfloats\u201d with more buoyancy (less density) than water, so someone with high body fat will have a lower body density than someone with low body fat and more muscle. In other words, if one\u2019s weight under water is heavier than on land due to more muscle mass and less fat, this indicates a lower body fat percentage (and visa versa). This method is accurate but costly and typically only used in a research setting. It can cause discomfort as individuals must completely submerge under water including the head, and then exhale completely before obtaining the reading.\n\n\n\n\nAir-Displacement Plethysmography\nThis method uses a similar principle to underwater weighing but can be done in the air instead of in water. [17] Individuals sit in a small chamber wearing a bathing suit; one commercial example is the \u201cBod Pod.\u201d The machine estimates body volume based on air pressure differences between the empty chamber and the occupied chamber. It is expensive but accurate, quick, and comfortable for those who prefer not to be submerged in water.",

It is expensive but accurate, quick, and comfortable for those who prefer not to be submerged in water.\n\n\n\n\nDilution Method (Hydrometry)\nIndividuals drink isotope-labeled water and give body fluid samples. Researchers analyze these samples for isotope levels, which are then used to calculate total body water, fat-free body mass, and in turn, body fat mass. [17] It is accurate, not as costly, and can be used in individuals with a BMI of 40 or higher, but accuracy can be decreased by illness, dehydration, or weight loss.\n\n\n\n\nDual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)\nX-ray beams pass through different body tissues at different rates. DEXA uses two low-level X-ray beams to develop estimates of fat-free mass, fat mass, and bone mineral density. [17] DEXA is accurate but uses heavy expensive equipment so is typically only used in research settings. It cannot distinguish between subcutaneous and visceral fat, cannot be used in persons sensitive to radiation (e.g., pregnant women, children), and cannot accommodate persons with a BMI of 35 or higher.\n\n\n\n\nComputerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nThese two imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate methods for measuring tissue, organ, and whole-body fat mass as well as lean muscle mass and bone mass. [17] It can measure specific body fat compartments, such as abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat. However, CT and MRI scans are typically used only in research settings because the equipment is extremely expensive and cannot be moved. CT scans cannot be used with pregnant women or children, due to exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain MRI and CT scanners may not be able to accommodate individuals with a BMI of 35 or higher.",

Individuals with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia\u2014and those with wasting diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and heart failure\u2014can lose so much weight that they don\u2019t have enough energy or basic building blocks to keep themselves alive. What about people who are thin but don\u2019t have an eating disorder or serious illness?\nSome studies suggest that the connection between body mass index and premature death follows a U-shaped curve. This means that weighing too much\u2014or too little\u2014isn\u2019t as healthy as weighing somewhere in the middle. The problem is that most of these studies included smokers and individuals with early, but undetected, chronic and fatal diseases. Cigarette smokers as a group weigh less than nonsmokers, in part because smoking deadens the appetite. Potentially deadly chronic diseases such as cancer, emphysema, kidney failure, and heart failure can cause weight loss even before they cause symptoms and have been diagnosed. So low weights don\u2019t necessarily cause early death. Instead, low weight is often the result of illnesses or habits that may be fatal.\nMany epidemiologic studies confirm that increasing weight is associated with increasing disease risk. The American Cancer Society fielded two large long-term Cancer Prevention Studies that \u00a0included more than one million adults who were followed for at least 12 years. [18,19] They excluded people who smoked and others who could experience secondary weight loss from an illness such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, or who developed a chronic disease in the first few years of follow-up. Both studies showed a clear pattern of increasing mortality with increasing weight. The data confirmed similar observations from a 27-year follow-up of more than 19,000 middle-aged men in the Harvard Alumni Health Study, [20] a 16-year follow-up of more than 115,000 middle-aged women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, [21] a 12-year follow-up of nonsmoking Seventh-day Adventists, [22] and a 10-year follow-up of more than 500,000 middle-aged men and women in the National Institutes of Health/AARP study. [23] Another analysis of the Cancer Prevention Study cohort found that increased weight was tied to increased mortality from all cancers and specific cancers; [24] in fact, study investigators estimated that overweight and obesity is responsible for 14% of all cancer deaths in women and 20% of all cancer deaths in men.\nAccording to the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans a body mass index below 18.5 falls outside the healthy range. But some people live long, healthy lives with a low body mass index. Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If you\u2019ve always had a low body mass index and your weight and health condition doesn\u2019t change much, don\u2019t worry. But if you start losing weight without trying, discuss with your doctor the reasons why this could be happening.

The strongest evidence to date shows that calories matter, but focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss.\n\n\nFocus on eating high-quality foods in appropriately sized portions.\n\nConsider quality, not just calories\n\u00a0\u201cA calorie is a calorie\u201d is an oft-repeated dietary slogan, and not overeating is indeed an important health measure. Rather than focusing on calories alone, however, emerging research shows that quality is also key in determining what we should eat and what we should avoid in order to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Rather than choosing foods based only on caloric value, think instead about choosing high-quality, healthy foods, and minimizing low-quality foods.\n\nHigh-quality foods include unrefined, minimally processed foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, healthy fats and healthy sources of protein \u2013 the foods recommended in the Healthy Eating Plate.\n\n\nLower-quality foods include highly processed snack foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined (white) grains, refined sugar, fried foods, foods high in saturated and trans fats, and high-glycemic foods such as potatoes.\n\nThere isn\u2019t one \u201cperfect\u201d diet for everyone, owing to individual differences in genes and lifestyle.\nQuality counts\nOne study analyzed whether certain foods were more or less likely to promote weight gain. This type of research examining specific foods and drinks allows us to understand whether \u201ca calorie is a calorie,\u201d or if eating more higher-quality foods and fewer lower-quality foods can lead to weight loss and maintenance.\nResearchers in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health show us that quality is in fact very important in determining what we should eat to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and that the notion of \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d does not tell the whole story.\n\nIn a study of over 120,000 healthy women and men spanning 20 years, researchers determined that weight change was most strongly associated with the intake of potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and both processed and unprocessed red meats. The researchers concluded that consumption of processed foods higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain.\n\n\nFoods shown to be associated with weight loss were vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.",
        "d9bee0f2-9470-4a28-8a73-576a6ee42a64": "Foods shown to be associated with weight loss were vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.\n\n\nResearchers did not discount the importance of calories, instead suggesting that choosing high-quality foods (and decreasing consumption of lower-quality foods) is an important factor in helping individuals consume fewer calories. (23)\n\nView the HSPH news release, \u201cChanges in specific dietary factors may have big impact on long-term weight gain: Weight-loss Strategy to Only \u2018Eat Less, Exercise More\u201d May be Overly Simplistic\u2019\u201d\nManaging macronutrients: Does it matter?\nWith the proliferation of macronutrient-based diets over the past several decades, from low-fat to low-carbohydrate, discussion of the three main macronutrients \u2013 carbohydrates, proteins, and fats \u2013 has become standard when talking about optimal diets. Researchers have begun comparing these \u201cmacronutrient management\u201d-style diets to one another in order to determine which is most effective, but thus far evidence is largely inconclusive.\nOne study, published in JAMA in 2007, compared four weight-loss diets ranging from low to high carbohydrate intake. This 12-month trial followed over 300 overweight and obese premenopausal women, randomly assigning them to either an Atkins (very low carbohydrate), Zone (low carbohydrate), LEARN (high carbohydrate), or Ornish (very high in carbohydrate) diet.\n\nAfter one year, weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups.\n\n\nThis study also examined secondary outcomes focused on metabolic effects (such as cholesterol, body fat percentage, glucose levels and blood pressure), and found that those for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.\n\n\nThere was no significant difference in weight loss among the other three diets (Zone, LEARN, and Ornish).\n\n\nThis study does raise questions about about long-term effects and mechanisms, but the researchers concluded that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible recommendation for weight loss. (24)\n\nAnother study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, challenged the above study\u2019s findings by testing four different types of diets and producing results that showed comparable average weight loss among the different diets.\n\nThe study followed 800 people over 2 years, assigning subjects to one of four diets: Low-fat and average-protein, low-fat and high-protein, high-fat and average-protein, and high-fat and high protein.\n\n\nResearchers concluded that all of the diets resulted in meaningful weight loss, despite the differences in macronutrient composition.\n\n\nThe study also found that the more group counseling sessions participants attended, the more weight they lost, and the less weight they regained. This supports the idea that not only is what you eat important, but behavioral, psychological, and social factors are important for weight loss as well. (25)\n\nAn additional study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, looked at the role of protein and glycemic index upon weight loss maintenance. Researchers first implemented a low-calorie diet to produce weight loss, then examined whether protein and glycemic index impacted weight loss maintenance.\n\nThe study population was made up of nearly 800 overweight adults from European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a low-calorie diet. Participants were then assigned one of five diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: A low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet.\n\n\nThe low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain, and weight regain was less in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet, as well as less in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet.",
        "62116e67-d589-49f2-82c4-ee1e49eca348": "The low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain, and weight regain was less in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet, as well as less in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet.\n\n\nThese results show that a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycemic index led to an improvement in maintenance of weight loss. (26)\n\nThe results from these three studies suggest that there may be some benefits to a macronutrient-based dietary approach, but research also shows that while a particular diet may result in weight loss for one person, it may not be effective for another person due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle. For those seeking the \u201cperfect\u201d one-size-fits-all diet, then, there isn\u2019t one! The great news is that everyone can follow The Healthy Eating Plate guidelines and choose healthy, flavorful foods to create a diet that works best for you.\nReferences\n\n23.

Check out our tips for how to reach a winning weight.\n\nLow-fat fails\nWhile low-fat was once the diet du jour, subsequent research has shown that low-fat diets are ineffective, and moreover, that eating healthy fats is beneficial for health.\n\nIn the United States, obesity has become increasingly common even as the percentage of fat in the American diet has declined from 45 percent in the 1960s to about 33 percent in the late 1990s. So, cutting fat is not shrinking waistlines. (27, 28)\n\n\nExperimental studies lasting one year or longer have not shown a link between dietary fat and weight. (29, 30)\n\n\nIn the eight-year Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, women assigned to a low-fat diet didn\u2019t lose or gain more weight than women eating their usual fare. (31)\n\nLow-carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets can be effective\nWhile many \u201cdiets\u201d are fads meant to be followed for short periods of time, research shows that some approaches, including some low-carbohydrate diets and Mediterranean diets can be good models upon which to base your own dietary strategy as long as they incorporate healthy, high-quality foods.\nOne study comparing a low-carbohydrate, low-fat, and Mediterranean diet followed over 300 people for a 2-year period and found that diets composed of different foods can lead to different weight loss outcomes.\u00a0 Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, this study concluded that:\n\nMediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets might be more effective than low-fat diets.\n\n\nThe positive effects of the low-carbohydrate diet and the Mediterranean diet upon lipids and glycemic control suggest that individualized dietary interventions \u2013 which take personal preferences and metabolic considerations into account \u2013 could be effective. (32)\n\nA large randomized trial on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease showed that among patients at high risk for CVD, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events over\u00a0 4.8-years of follow-up. (33)\n\nThis was the first randomized trial that showed reduced cardiac events over a long follow-up period, so it provided strong scientific evidence that the Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy dietary approach.",

(33)\n\nThis was the first randomized trial that showed reduced cardiac events over a long follow-up period, so it provided strong scientific evidence that the Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy dietary approach.\n\n\nThough this study focused on cardiovascular outcomes rather than weight loss, it still provides solid evidence that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d is not the case, and that instead, food quality is a key contributor to personal health.\n\n\nIt also shows that low-fat diets are continuing to lose credibility, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 \u00a0can improve heart health and weight loss.\n\nWhat exactly is a \u201cMediterranean\u201d Diet?\nThere isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes into account the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern.\nConclusion:\u00a0 The best diet incorporates high-quality foods in appropriate portions; there isn\u2019t one \u201cperfect\u201d diet for everyone.\nCalories matter, but quality is equally important. When making dietary decisions, regardless of whether you choose a certain dietary style such as low-carbohydrate or Mediterranean, you can also use the Healthy Eating Plate as a guide for how to fill your plate.\nA healthy diet for weight loss also needs to be sustainable, and regardless of what you\u2019re eating, you need to make sure you\u2019re not eating too many calories overall. Calories do matter, but focus first on choosing high-quality, healthy foods.\nReferences\n\n27. Is total fat consumption really decreasing, U.C.f.N.P.a. Promotion, Editor. 1998.\n28.

So how to differentiate what \u201cworks\u201d from an overhyped fad?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that even if a particular diet may be successful for one person, it may not be effective for another due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle.\u00a0And while research shows that calories matter, focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and promoting weight loss. Diets are also more likely to be successful when they are easier to follow, so tailoring a strategy to suit your own lifestyle is key.\nStill, when faced with the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans, it helps to see what evidence is supporting them. In this series, we take a look at some popular diets and approaches to eating\u2014and review the research behind them.\nAnti-Inflammatory DietAn anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that \u201cinflammation\u201d is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by our\u00a0immune system. Learn more about anti-inflammatory diets: how they work, potential pitfalls, and what the research says.\nClean EatingOnce just a buzzword, \u201cclean eating\u201d is now a popular eating style. What it means will depend on who you ask. The terms clean eating and clean diets are not federally regulated in the U.S., so interpretation by consumers and the marketing of \u201cclean\u201d products by the food industry can vary widely. Learn more about the potential pros and cons of this approach to eating.\n\nDASH DietThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure, however numerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of this eating pattern.\u00a0Learn more about DASH: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says.\nGluten-Free for Weight LossA gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. As the sole treatment for the 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, this diet is not new.\u00a0What is new\u2014and driving these sales upward\u2014is the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss. Learn more about a gluten-free diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss.\u00a0\nIntermittent Fasting for Weight LossIntermittent fasting is a diet regimen that cycles between brief periods of fasting, with either no food or significant calorie reduction, and periods of unrestricted eating.",

When these needs are recognized, they may determine one\u2019s food choices. Learn more about intuitive eating: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the available research says.\n\nKetogenic Diet for Weight LossThe ketogenic or \u201cketo\u201d diet is a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich eating plan that has been used for centuries to treat specific medical conditions.\u00a0However in recent years, this diet has gained considerable attention as a potential weight-loss strategy.\u00a0Learn more about the keto diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss.\u00a0\nMediterranean DietThe Mediterranean diet is a primarily plant-based eating plan that includes daily intake of whole grains, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes, nuts, herbs, and spices. Other foods like animal proteins are eaten in smaller quantities, with the preferred animal protein being fish and seafood. It does not specify portion sizes or specific amounts, as it is up to the individual to decide exactly how much food to eat at each meal.\u00a0Learn more about the Mediterranean diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says.\nMIND Diet Dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, driving many people to search for ways to prevent cognitive decline. The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet, targets the health of the aging brain. Learn more about the MIND diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says.\n\nMindful EatingThis approach to eating focuses on the eating experience, body-related sensations, and thoughts and feelings about food, with heightened awareness and without judgment. Attention is paid to the foods being chosen, internal and external physical cues, and your responses to those cues. Learn more about the mindful eating: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the available research says.\nPaleo Diet for Weight LossThe Paleolithic or \u201cPaleo\u201d diet seeks to address 21st century ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Learn more about the Paleo diet: how it works, potential pitfalls, and what the research says about this strategy for weight loss.\u00a0\nLast reviewed December 2022\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Research strongly supports its benefits across a range of physical and mental health conditions for people of all ages. However, busy lifestyles and an environment that encourages being sedentary for many hours of the day (driving door-to-door, sitting at an office desk, relaxing for the evening in front of a television) have led to exercise ranking low as a priority for many people.\nTypes of Exercise\nAll types of exercises offer health benefits. Performing different types of exercises can expand the range of benefits even further. But it is important to remember that some exercise is better than none, and that most everyone can participate in some form of exercise safely.\nAerobic/Cardiovascular physical activity. These are activities that are intense enough and performed long enough to maintain or improve one\u2019s heart and lung fitness. Examples: walking, jogging, dancing, bicycling, basketball, soccer, swimming\nMuscle-strengthening activity. This may be referred to as resistance training. These activities maintain or increase muscle strength, endurance, and power. Examples: weight machines, free weights, resistance elastic bands, Pilates, daily activities of living (lifting children, carrying groceries or laundry, climbing stairs)\nFlexibility training. This may be referred to as stretching. It lengthens or flexes a skeletal muscle to the point of tension, and holds for several seconds to increase elasticity and range of motion around a joint. Improving flexibility can enhance the overall physical performance of other types of exercise. Examples: dynamic stretches performed with movement (yoga, tai chi), static stretches without movement (holding a pose for several seconds or longer), passive stretching (using an external force like a strap or wall to hold an elongated pose), and active stretching (holding a pose without an external force)\nBalance training. These activities are intended to throw off one\u2019s balance to improve body control and stability. They can help to prevent falls and other injuries. Examples: standing on one foot, walking heel-to-toe in a perfectly straight line, standing on a balance or wobble board\nMeasures of Exercise Intensity\nAlthough just moving more and sitting less offers health benefits, how much energy you use while exercising can increase those health benefits further. This is referred to as energy intensity.\nBorg Scale\nThe Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion measures your exercise intensity by rating how you feel. It is based on observations like higher heart rate, heavier and faster breathing, increased sweating, and muscles feeling tired. It does not use actual measurements of these occurrences but a personal self-check.\nThe scale uses numbers from 6 to 20. The lowest rating is \u201cno feeling of exertion,\u201d at number 6, and the highest rating is \u201cvery, very hard,\u201d at number 20. Moderate activities register 11 to 14 (\u201cfairly light\u201d to \u201csomewhat hard\u201d) while vigorous activities usually rate 15 or higher (\u201chard\u201d to \u201cvery, very hard\u201d). Dr. Gunnar Borg, who created the scale, set it to run from 6 to 20 as a simple way to estimate heart rate\u2014multiplying the Borg score by 10 gives an approximate heart rate for a particular level of activity. [1]\n\n\nThe Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion\n\n\n\nHow you might describe your exertion \nBorg rating of your exertion \nExamples\n(for most adults <65 years old) \n\n\nNone\n\u00a06\nReading a book, watching television\n\n\nVery, very light\n\u00a07 to 8\nTying shoes\n\n\nVery light\n\u00a09 to 10\nChores like folding clothes that seem to take little effort\n\n\nFairly light\n11 to 12\nWalking through the grocery store or other activities that require some effort but not enough to speed up your breathing",

You can use the Borg Scale to change the intensity, by speeding up or slowing down movements or applying more or less resistance (such as increasing the incline on a treadmill or turning the resistance\u00a0control knob on a stationary bicycle).\nTarget Heart Rate\nCalculating your heart rate and target heart rate can be used to measure exercise intensity. First determine your maximum heart rate: subtract your age from 220 (example: the maximum heart rate for a 40-year-old person would be 220 \u2013 40 = 180 beats per minute). The target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise is between 65-75% of your maximum heart rate (or 77-93% of maximum heart rate for vigorous exercise). So for the 40-year-old person with a maximum heart rate of 180, the target heart rate falls somewhere between 117-135 beats per minute for moderate exercise, or 139-167 for vigorous exercise.\nThen measure your actual heart rate in either of these two ways:\n\nMidway through the exercise, stop to check your pulse. Place the tips of your index and middle fingers at the wrist and press lightly on the artery in line with the thumb. Count the heartbeats for 30 seconds and multiply by 2.\nWear a heart rate monitor. Some pedometers have a built-in heart rate monitor that displays your current heartbeats per minute.\n\nMETs\nMET stands for the metabolic equivalent of task. One MET is the amount of energy used while sitting quietly. Physical activities may be rated using METs to indicate their intensity. For example, reading may use about 1.3 METs while running may use 8-9 METs. METs can also be translated into light, moderate, and vigorous intensities of exercise.\n\nSedentary\u2014Uses 1.5 or fewer METs. Examples are sitting, reclining, or lying down.\nLight intensity\u2014Uses from 1.6-3.0 METs. Examples are walking at a leisurely pace or standing in line at the store.\nModerate intensity\u2014Uses from 3.0-6.0 METs. Examples are walking briskly, vacuuming, or raking leaves.\nVigorous intensity\u2014Uses from 6.0+ METs. Examples are walking very quickly, running, taking an aerobics class, or shoveling snow.\n\n\n\nMore on METs\n\nExercise experts measure activity in metabolic equivalents, or METs. One MET is defined as the energy it takes to sit quietly. For the average adult, this is about one calorie per every 2.2 pounds of body weight per hour; someone who weighs 160 pounds would burn approximately 70 calories an hour while sitting or sleeping.\nModerate-intensity activities are those that get you moving fast enough or strenuously enough to burn off three to six times as much energy per minute as you do when you are sitting quietly, or exercises that clock in at 3 to 6 METs. Vigorous-intensity activities burn more than 6 METs.\nOne limitation to this way of measuring exercise intensity is that it does not consider the fact that some people have a higher level of fitness than others. Thus, walking at 3 to 4 miles-per-hour is considered to require 4 METs and to be a moderate-intensity activity, regardless of who is doing the activity\u2014a young marathon runner or a 90-year-old grandmother. As you might imagine, a brisk walk would likely be an easy activity for the marathon runner, but a very hard activity for the grandmother.\nThis table gives examples of light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity activity for healthy adults:",

Try to be physically active throughout the day. Adult caregivers should encourage children this age to engage in active playing for at least 3 hours daily.\nChildren and adolescents ages 6 through 17. At least 1 hour daily of moderate-to-vigorous activity with both aerobic and strength movements.\nAdults. Move more frequently throughout the day and sit less. Engage in at least 150 to 300 minutes weekly (spaced throughout the week) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and at least 2 days weekly of muscle-strengthening exercises. Greater health benefits may be seen with more than 300 minutes weekly of exercise.\nOlder adults. Follow similar activity guidelines as those for adults but also include a focus on balance training. Although discussing the start of a new exercise regimen with one\u2019s doctor is a good practice for all ages, it is especially important with this age group because of the higher likelihood of having health conditions or physical limitations that may require modified exercises. See additional physical activity considerations for older adults.\u00a0\nWomen who are pregnant or postpartum. Aim for 150 minutes weekly (spaced throughout the week) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. If vigorous exercise was performed regularly prior to pregnancy, one may continue this throughout pregnancy after discussing with their doctor. See additional physical activity considerations for pregnancy.\u00a0\nAdults with physical disabilities and chronic conditions. Follow similar activity guidelines as those for adults if able to exercise, but discuss with one\u2019s doctor about the types and amounts of activity that would be appropriate for specific conditions. Any exercises within one\u2019s ability is encouraged, to avoid being completely sedentary. See additional physical activity considerations for chronic conditions.\u00a0\n\nThe frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise are helpful terms to consider when deciding on an exercise regimen.\n\nFrequency: How often will you do the activity\u2014once a day, three times a week, twice a month?\nDuration: How long is the exercise session\u201420 minutes, 1 hour, 30 minutes split into two sessions in one day?\nIntensity: How much energy is needed\u2014light versus vigorous activity, 3 METs versus 6 METs?\n\nWearable trackers for physical activityIf you are health-conscious, chances are you like seeing data that reveals information on how you are doing. Pedometers, heart rate monitors, and sleep trackers can all analyze what goes on inside our bodies. Most of these devices are combined with a smartphone or computer app that provide tracking tools to better manage personal health, and can be an effective source of motivational support. [3] The data may be shared with one\u2019s physician or other health care provider to monitor progress with physical activity goals. Trackers can motivate people to change behavior, whether this means getting up and moving more, going to bed earlier, or advancing an exercise routine to challenge the heart. [4] But how reliable are they?\nGenerally these trackers are pretty accurate when measuring steps taken. But other measures, such as how many calories are burned, can overestimate or underestimate the actual amount. Studies looking at the accuracy of devices in tracking calories used while exercising tend to be small in size. In one study, 14 participants wearing different popular brand devices walked and ran. The estimated calorie usage displayed on the devices was compared with measurements from indirect calorimetry (a reliably accurate technique to measure calorie output). The results were mixed. Some of the devices were accurate for calorie expenditure with running but not walking and visa versa. Some of the devices overestimated the amount of calories used during exercise. [5] Other studies found similar discrepancies. [6]\nTracking devices can be useful for personal motivation and accountability, but the data should be interpreted with caution as there are variable readings among devices.",

[6]\nTracking devices can be useful for personal motivation and accountability, but the data should be interpreted with caution as there are variable readings among devices. The accuracy of the data may also vary within the same device when performing different intensities of exercise. [6] They are best used with other methods to gauge fitness levels, such as monitoring the frequency, duration, and perceived exertion of your exercise routine. It\u2019s also important to have motivation to exercise because you enjoy how you feel during and after the exercise, not just to reach a certain number on a tracker.\nExercise Safety\nSafety should be a major priority when exercising. Any physical activity carries the risk of injury, whether you are just starting an exercise regimen or are a seasoned fitness buff. But don\u2019t let this stop you from moving because the health benefits of being active far outweigh any risks. Using caution and patience can reduce the risk of injuries.\nCommon workout injuries include:\n\nStrained or pulled muscles\nAnkle sprain\nKnee strain\nInflamed tendons or ligaments\nRotator cuff (shoulder) injury\nOveruse injuries caused by repetitive movements using mainly one part of the body\n\nIn very\u00a0rare cases, vigorous physical activity may lead to a heart attack or sudden death. Active people have a lower\u00a0risk of serious or fatal heart problems than inactive people.\nCommon missteps:\nNot talking with your doctor first. If you are new to exercise or have medical conditions, let your doctor know what type of exercise you\u2019ll be starting. They can review the format to ensure it is safe with a specific health condition.\nDoing too much too soon. This is very common as people may be highly motivated when starting a new exercise program. However, forcing your body to move with too much intensity can be jarring to the heart, muscles, and joints that may lack strength from inactivity. This often leads to injury. Even if starting slowly feels too easy, plan to progress exercise gradually. Start with light to moderate-intensity movements for a shorter amount of time, and continue this for a few weeks. As you develop strength and stamina, you can add minutes and higher-intensity movements every few weeks.\nLeaving out the warm-up and cool-down. A warm-up before exercising includes light movements that initiate the flow of blood and loosening of muscles and joints. An example would be 5-10 minutes of marching in place, doing arm circles, and neck rolls. After exercising, the cool-down is important to slow down the body and heart rate steadily, as a sudden stop in movements can interfere with blood flow to the brain and cause lightheadedness or dizziness. A cool-down could be simply slowing the pace of whatever exercise being performed for 10 minutes (if jogging, change to a walk; if on a stationary bicycle, release any tension on the resistance knob and peddle slower). The cool-down period may also include stretches that are most effective when the muscles are warmed from exercising; stretches help to lengthen muscles that will protect against injuries. A cool-down with stretching can also lessen muscle soreness the following day.\nHow to get started safely\n\nIf you have a chronic health condition or are pregnant, let your doctor know of your desire to start exercising.\nIf you are sedentary, start with activities that are lower impact and require a light-to-moderate effort, such as walking, gardening, stationary bicycling, or swimming. Progress gradually\u2014it\u2019s especially important to \u201cstart low and go slow.\u201d\nProtect yourself:\n\nChoose the right equipment. If you\u2019re cycling, wear a bike helmet. If you\u2019re going out for a walk, pull on a well-fitting pair of sneakers instead of a pair of flip flops. Generally, exercise shoes should be replaced very 4-6 months as the cushioning wears out.\nFind a safe place to work out. Seek out streets that have sidewalks or bicycle lanes, or visit a local park. Play basketball on well-maintained courts.\nPay attention to the weather.",

Play basketball on well-maintained courts.\nPay attention to the weather. In the middle of a heat wave, exercise in the morning or evening when it\u2019s cooler out, exercise indoors, or hit the swimming pool instead of the tennis court. Be aware of signs of overheating like dizziness, nausea, headache, cramping, and a racing heart rate that doesn\u2019t slow down even when stopping the exercise.\n\n\nStay hydrated with water. The amount will vary depending on the temperature (more is needed in very hot and humid conditions) and level of exercise. For moderate workouts of one hour or less, bring about 24 ounces of water to drink during and after exercising.\nChoose healthy \u201cfuel.\u201d A diet with adequate amounts of healthy protein and carbohydrates is sufficient to fuel the body for low to moderate amounts of physical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling.\nBe wary of supplement claims. Fitness gurus and advertisements touting workout supplements as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, and explosive muscle growth might have you believing you can\u2019t effectively exercise without them. Although some supplements have been researched for use in regular high-intensity, strenuous physical activity (such as marathon training or power lifting), it\u2019s important to note they are not regulated for safety. Be sure to consult with a doctor before incorporating them into your exercise routine and discuss if there are any potential contraindications if you have existing medical conditions. Learn more about the research on common workout supplements.\nListen to your body. If you feel very fatigued, pain, or lightheaded while exercising, slow down the workout or end it early.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between muscle pain and muscle soreness?It is normal and healthy to feel moderately sore muscles the day after a vigorous workout. The soreness is usually noted in the general area of the body that was used while exercising. This is caused by the accumulation of lactic acid as well as small tears in muscle fibers that become inflamed; after 48 hours the lactic acid begins to dispel and muscle tissue is repaired so the soreness should lessen. Although you may not want to move at all when experiencing muscle soreness, this can actually delay healing. Doing light movements like walking or stretching can increase blood flow and circulation, speeding healing time.\nOn the other hand, sharp pain in a specific area that starts during the workout or soon after could be a sign of a more serious injury. See a doctor if the pain does not lessen in a day or two or you notice swelling or bruising around the painful area.\n\n10 Tips to Keep Moving\n\nPlan exercise into your day.\u00a0Intention is an important first step. Set aside a specific time in your schedule to exercise and write it in your planner.\nAccountability helps. If your motivation is lagging, connect with a friend or family member with a similar goal to move more.\u00a0A workout partner can help keep you on track and motivate you to get out the door.\nTry counting steps.\u00a0Step-counters or pedometers are an easy, inexpensive way to remind yourself to move. Working up to 10,000 steps per day can be a good general goal. If that seems too intimidating, measure your steps on an average day and increase by 1000 steps every two weeks.\nKeep it brisk.\u00a0When you walk, make it brisk, since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace. What is brisk enough? Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late.\nTurn off the TV, computer, and smart phone.\u00a0Chances are that if you turn off these devices for an hour or two, you will automatically move more and curb your \u201csit time.\u201d Fill the time by doing household chores, running errands, playing with the kids, or taking a stroll around your neighborhood.\nTurn sit time into fit time. Try to combine movement with a sedentary activity that you already do.",

Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late.\nTurn off the TV, computer, and smart phone.\u00a0Chances are that if you turn off these devices for an hour or two, you will automatically move more and curb your \u201csit time.\u201d Fill the time by doing household chores, running errands, playing with the kids, or taking a stroll around your neighborhood.\nTurn sit time into fit time. Try to combine movement with a sedentary activity that you already do. For example, perform squats, marching in place, jumping jacks, push-ups, or sit-ups while watching TV or throughout each commercial. Fidgeting, or its scientific term non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), also uses extra energy. Studies show that people who are lean incorporate more NEAT movements throughout the day compared with people who are overweight. [7] This might mean pacing around while talking on the phone, tapping your feet when sitting, drumming your fingers on a desk or your leg, or wiggling your toes. For inspiration on how to move \u201ccreactively\u201d wherever you are, check out Activating a Move-Friendly World.\nMove at the office. If you work long shifts or care for a busy family after hours, fitting in a workout can be daunting. So focus on moving at the office even if you have a sedentary desk job. Make climbing stairs and avoiding elevators the norm, park as far from the front office door as possible, set a reminder to get up and walk for 5 minutes each hour (that could add up to 40 minutes in a day!), or follow a short desk exercise video online.\nSplit the workout. If you are new to exercise and find a 30-minute session challenging, split it into two 15-minute sessions. The fitness benefit may actually be greater if you can exercise with higher energy and intensity in two shorter bouts, than if you tried to exercise for 30 minutes but slowed down from fatigue towards the end.\nSign up for a class or a specific event. Check out the fitness class schedule at your local gym, yoga studio, or community center. Some offer virtual classes with a live instructor but which you can do at home. Or sign up for a specific event like a road race or walk-for-charity a few months out; this can help drive you to train regularly the weeks leading up to the event. You may find that having a target date or the structure of a weekly class keeps you consistent.\nReward yourself.\u00a0Set short-term goals\u2014then acknowledge and reward yourself when achieving them. Positive affirmations are key to building confidence as you commit to ongoing fitness goals. Treat yourself to new exercise shoes, clothing, or workout gear; a new book; or a massage.\n\nThe influence of music in exerciseResearch has shown various physical and mental benefits of music in enhancing exercise performance. Music can help people to experience greater enjoyment and a lower perception of fatigue and \u201cwork\u201d during repetitive endurance exercise, even while achieving a faster heart rate and deeper breathing. This can also help to increase blood flow and promote muscle recovery during high-intensity exercise. Studies have shown that music can increase a positive mood compared with controls who do not listen to music while exercising.

[1]\nPeople are more likely to be active if they live near parks and playgrounds, in neighborhoods that have sidewalks or bike paths, or close enough to work, school, or shopping that they can travel by bike or on foot. People are less likely to be active if they live in neighborhoods without recreation facilities or in sprawling suburbs designed for driving.\nMoving to another neighborhood is not a viable option for most people. Instead, communities need to create built environments that make it easier for people to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. [2, 3]\u00a0Local and state leaders control budgets, zoning, and a variety of regulations that shape our physical surroundings, and there are many strategies communities can use to promote safe environments for activity: [2, 3]\n\nImproving access to parks, walking and biking paths, community gardens, and other outdoor recreation facilities\nCreating attractive sidewalks and so-called \u201ccycle tracks,\u201d barrier-protected and bicycle-exclusive facilities alongside sidewalks\nCurbing traffic so that people feel safer walking and cycling\nBuilding schools within easy walking distance of where people live\nImproving public transportation to encourage more people to use it\nChanging zoning rules to allow \u201cmixed-use development\u201d\u2014if communities allowed homes, stores, schools, offices, and other buildings to be built close to each other, people would be more likely to walk or bike from place to place, rather than hop in the car\nMaking neighborhoods safer to encourage people to be active outdoors\nAllowing community residents to use schools for recreation, after school hours\n\nIndividuals can help by becoming advocates for change, and also by pitching in. Volunteer to clean up a local park, join a neighborhood crime watch, start a petition to add crosswalks along a popular walking route, or to turn parking spaces into cycle tracks along busy streets.\nVisit The Obesity Prevention Source to learn more about why the \u201cbuilt environment\u201d\u2014the actual physical structures that make up the places where we live, eat, work, play, and go to school\u2014is a key component in the fight against obesity.\nReferences\n\nSallis, J.F. and K.

There are three main types of stress that may occur in our everyday lives: acute (a brief event such as a heated argument or getting stuck in a traffic jam), acute episodic (frequent acute events such as work deadlines), and chronic stress (persistent events like unemployment from a job loss, physical or mental abuse, substance abuse, or family conflict). Many of us may experience a combination of these three types.\nOur bodies react to all types of stress via the same mechanism, which occurs regardless if the stress arises from a real or perceived event. Both acute and chronic stressors cause the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response. Hormones are released that instigate several actions within seconds: pumping blood and oxygen quickly to our cells, quickening the heart rate, and increasing mental alertness. In prehistoric times, this rapid response was needed to quickly escape a dangerous situation or fight off a predator. However all types of stress can trigger this response, as described in more detail below:\n\nA very small region at the base of the brain, called the hypothalamus, sets off the reaction and communicates with the body through the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This system regulates involuntary responses like blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and digestion. The ANS signals nerves and the hormone corticotropin to alert the adrenal glands, located on the top of each kidney, to release a hormone called adrenaline into the blood. [1]\nAdrenaline (also known as epinephrine) quickens the heart rate and increases blood pressure so more blood circulates to the muscles and heart to support a boost of energy. More oxygen in the blood is available to the heart, lungs, and brain to accommodate faster breathing and heightened alertness. Even one\u2019s vision and hearing may become sharpened.\nIf stress continues, the adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, which stimulates the release of glucose into the blood and increases the brain\u2019s use of glucose for energy. It also turns off certain systems in the body to allow the body to focus on the stress response. These systems include digestion, reproduction, and growth.\nThese hormones do not return to normal levels until the stress passes. If the stress does not pass, the nervous system continues to trigger physical reactions that can eventually lead to inflammation and damage to cells.\n\nWith acute stress, the event is brief and hormone levels will gradually return to normal.",

Even one\u2019s vision and hearing may become sharpened.\nIf stress continues, the adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, which stimulates the release of glucose into the blood and increases the brain\u2019s use of glucose for energy. It also turns off certain systems in the body to allow the body to focus on the stress response. These systems include digestion, reproduction, and growth.\nThese hormones do not return to normal levels until the stress passes. If the stress does not pass, the nervous system continues to trigger physical reactions that can eventually lead to inflammation and damage to cells.\n\nWith acute stress, the event is brief and hormone levels will gradually return to normal. Acute episodic and chronic stress repeatedly trigger the fight-or-flight response causing a persistent elevation of hormones, leading to a risk of health problems: [2]\n\nDigestive issues (heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation)\nWeight gain\nElevated blood pressure\nChest pain, heart disease\nImmune system problems\nSkin conditions\nMuscular pain (headaches, back pain, neck pain)\nSleep disruption, insomnia\nInfertility\nAnxiety, depression\n\nHow Chronic Stress Affects Eating Patterns\nChronic stress can affect the body\u2019s use of calories and nutrients in various ways. It raises the body\u2019s metabolic needs and increases the use and excretion of many nutrients. If one does not eat a nutritious diet, a deficiency may occur. [2] Stress also creates a chain reaction of behaviors that can negatively affect eating habits, leading to other health problems down the road.\n\nStress places a greater demand on the body for oxygen, energy, and nutrients. Yet people who experience chronic stress may crave comforting foods such as highly processed snacks or sweets, which are high in fat and calories but low in nutrients. [3]\nPeople feeling stress may lack the time or motivation to prepare nutritious, balanced meals, or may skip or forget to eat meals.\nStress can disrupt sleep by causing lighter sleep or more frequent awakenings, which leads to fatigue during the day. [4] In order to cope with daytime fatigue, people may use stimulants to increase energy such as with caffeine or high-calorie snack foods. The reverse may also be true that poor-quality sleep is itself a stressor. Studies have found that sleep restriction causes a significant increase in cortisol levels. [4]\nDuring acute stress, the hormone adrenaline suppresses the appetite. [5] But with chronic stress, elevated levels of cortisol may cause cravings, particularly for foods high in sugar, fat, and calories, which may then lead to weight gain. [5,6]\nCortisol favors the accumulation of fat in the belly area, also called central adiposity, which is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain breast cancers. [5,7-9] It also lowers levels of the hormone leptin (that promotes satiety) while increasing the hormone ghrelin (that increases appetite). [3]\n\nTips to Help Control Stress\n\nHealthy diet. A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and the repair of damaged cells. It provides the extra energy needed to cope with stressful events. Early research suggests that certain foods like polyunsaturated fats including omega-3 fats and vegetables may help to regulate cortisol levels. [10] If you frequently rely on fast food because you are tired or too busy to prepare meals at home, consider meal planning, a practice that can help save time in the long run, ensure more balanced healthful meals, and prevent weight gain.\nMindful eating. When we \u201cstress-eat,\u201d we eat quickly without noticing what or how much we\u2019re eating, which can lead to weight gain. Mindful eating practices counteract stress by encouraging deep breaths, making thoughtful food choices, focusing attention on the meal, and chewing food slowly and thoroughly. This increases enjoyment of the meal and improves digestion. Mindful eating can also help us realize when we are eating not because of physiological hunger but because of psychological turbulence, which may lead us to eat more as a coping mechanism.\nRegular exercise. Physical activity will help to lower blood pressure and stress hormone levels. Aerobic exercise like walking and dancing increases breathing and heart rate so that more oxygen reaches cells throughout the body. This reduces tension in muscles, including the heart.\nMeditation or deep breathing techniques. Fast, shallow breathing and erratic thoughts occur in response to stress. Therefore, take slow deep breaths to reduce muscular tension, lower the heart rate, and calm the mind. Whenever you feel stressed, breathe slowly, focusing on each in- and out-breath.",

Through this simple act, your parasympathetic nervous system kicks in and can help you calm down. If you\u2019d like some guidance, try this short mindful breathing exercise. Additionally, certain exercises like yoga and tai chi emphasize deep breathing and a focused mind.\n\nResearch has also found that meditation training may lengthen or prevent the shortening of protein structures called telomeres. [11] Telomeres generally shrink in length with age and in those experiencing chronic stress; this can lead to the death of cells and inflammation, which is associated with an increased risk of age-related dementia and cardiovascular disease. Meditation practice has been associated in some studies with greater telomere activity and length in response to a reduction in anxiety, chronic stress, and cortisol levels.\n\n\nMental health counseling or other social support. Feeling alone can add to stress. It can help to talk through feelings and concerns with a trusted individual. Often, just realizing that you are not alone and that your feelings are not unusual can help lower stress.\nPracticing work-life balance. Use vacation and personal time, or just set aside an hour a day. A periodic escape from the pressures of work can do wonders to reduce stress, increase productivity, and decrease the risk of physical and mental illnesses that are associated with workplace burnout.\nSchedule fun activities or hobbies at least once a week. Gardening, reading, enjoying music, getting a massage, hiking in nature, and cooking a favorite recipe are examples of welcome stress relievers.\nGood sleep hygiene. Stress can cause a heightened sense of alertness, which delays the onset of sleep as well as cause interrupted sleep throughout the night. This can prevent one from entering the deeper sleep stages in which the body repairs and grows tissue and supports a healthy immune system. The REM (rapid eye movement) sleep stage in particular helps with mood regulation and memory. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep a night by slowing down about 30 minutes before bedtime. Controlling stress through the other tips listed above can also improve sleep quality.",

Although we may feel that sleep simply rests our tired bodies, our brain remains active throughout the night. Sleep plays a critical role in brain as well as physical functioning.\nWhat Happens When We Sleep? \nOur internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime.\nThere are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles.\nNon-REM sleep\nStage 1. You transition from being awake to a restful state.\nStage 2. You are in a light sleep state. Your breathing, heart rate, and muscle movements slow down. Brain activity also slows, and your body temperature drops.\nStage 3. You are in a deep sleep state. This stage often occurs early in the sleep cycle immediately following light sleep. Your heart rate and breathing are the slowest during this phase, and you are not easily awakened. Events of the day are processed and stored in your memory. A lack of deep sleep can leave one feeling tired in the morning even if achieving an adequate duration of sleep.\nREM sleep\nDuring REM, your pupils twitch and move quickly from side to side underneath closed eyelids. Brain activity rises as you breathe faster and your heart rate increases. It is the phase of sleep when dreams are most common, and certain nerves signal your limbs to become temporarily paralyzed so you do not act out the dream. REM tends to occur later at night and into early morning. Memory is processed and stored during REM sleep.\nWhy do we dream?Dreams occur during the REM sleep stage and may include events or thoughts you experienced recently. Dreams may occur to help process emotions caused by those events. People report dreaming in vivid color as well as in black and white. Sometimes even a wild crazy dream can be forgotten by the time we awaken in the morning.\n\nHormones that Regulate Sleep Cycles\nThere are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. [1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness.",

[1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness.\n\nGABA is a neurotransmitter that decreases nerve cell activity, playing a major role in allowing the body to sleep.\nAdenosine is another neurotransmitter that gradually accumulates in the brain during the day, and at high concentrations makes us sleepy at night. Caffeine in coffee and other beverages can keep us awake as it blocks brain receptors for adenosine.\nMelatonin is a hormone released by the brain when it is dark. It travels to cells to tell the body to sleep. Sunlight or exposure to light inhibits the production of melatonin and increases the release of cortisol, which awakens us. If we are exposed to too much artificial light (such as the blue light emitted from smartphones or televisions) late at night, less melatonin may be released making it harder to fall asleep.\nSerotonin, the body\u2019s \u201cfeel-good\u201d chemical, is a neurotransmitter associated with both sleep and being awake. The brain releases this chemical during daylight but also uses it to form melatonin at night.\nHormones that counteract sleep include norepinephrine, adrenaline, histamine, and cortisol. These are secreted in response to stress and cause the body to be awake and alert. If one experiences prolonged or chronic stress, the body releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn releases cortisol. Levels of ACTH tend to be higher in people who have insomnia.\u00a0\n\nImmediate Effects of Sleep Deprivation\nAbout one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2,3] Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Because of the public health burden of poor sleep health, achieving sufficient sleep in children and adults was included as a goal in the Healthy People 2020 goals. [4]\nSleep helps to process your thoughts from the day as well as store memories, so a lack of good-quality sleep can lead to difficulty focusing and thinking clearly. You may feel tired, irritable, or anxious during the day. Performance at work or school may suffer. Your reaction time may be slowed, increasing the risk of driving accidents.\nIn children, insufficient sleep can lead to attention and behavior problems or hyperactivity. In the elderly, lack of sleep may decrease focus and attention, leading to a greater risk of falls, bone fractures, and car accidents.\nThere are several reasons people may get insufficient sleep:\n\nPoor sleep habits (watching television or using screens late at night, drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages at night, not following a regular sleep schedule).\nYour sleep environment is too noisy, too light or otherwise not conducive to sleep.\nYou attempt to sleep outside of the body\u2019s natural circadian clock (working an overnight shift and trying to make up for sleep during the day).\nYou have a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or periodic limb movements that reduces deep or REM sleep or causes frequent awakenings.\nYou have a medical condition such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or chronic pain, which causes frequent awakenings.\n\nSleep Deficiency and Disease Risk\nIf you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.",
        "57defcd0-1d59-4534-aa84-cc04dfb8ab12": "Your sleep environment is too noisy, too light or otherwise not conducive to sleep.\nYou attempt to sleep outside of the body\u2019s natural circadian clock (working an overnight shift and trying to make up for sleep during the day).\nYou have a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea, insomnia, or periodic limb movements that reduces deep or REM sleep or causes frequent awakenings.\nYou have a medical condition such as heart, lung or kidney disease, or chronic pain, which causes frequent awakenings.\n\nSleep Deficiency and Disease Risk\nIf you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.\n\n\nObesity\n\nSeveral studies show that sleep deprivation (i.e., regularly less than 7 hours of sleep a night) is a risk factor for obesity. A Nurses\u2019 Health Study found an association between those who slept the least (5 hours or less a night) and having the highest BMI and greatest weight gain. [5] One reason may be a disruption in appetite hormones that regulate feelings of hunger (called ghrelin) versus satisfaction (called leptin). Ghrelin levels rise while leptin levels drop with lack of sleep; this can cause higher calories to be consumed due to experiencing strong hunger at the same time that one feels less satiated after eating. A preference for foods high in fat and carbohydrate has been observed. [6,7] The risk of hunger also increases simply by being awake longer, which prolongs the time from the last meal eaten to bedtime. [6] Insufficient sleep also can trigger the \u201creward\u201d areas in your brain to crave high fat, high caloric foods. [8]\nOne may think that getting less sleep would mean more activity due to being awake longer and therefore using more calories. However, studies have found either no increase or very small increases in energy expenditure with sleep deprivation, and even a tendency towards reduced physical activity due to fatigue. [9] Less physical activity combined with the increased calorie intake associated with sleep deprivation increases the risk of obesity.\nOther effects of poor sleep include increased fat storage in the belly area, higher body mass index, poorer quality diet, and decreased insulin sensitivity. [6,10] Interestingly, some studies have also shown that longer sleep times (more than 9 hours) are also associated with developing belly fat compared with sleeping 7-8 hours a night. [7]\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes\n\nEpidemiological and laboratory studies show a higher risk of diabetes mellitus with both too little sleep (less than 7 hours) and longer sleep durations (more than 9 hours). Metabolic changes may occur with chronic insufficient sleep, such as higher cortisol levels leading to increased blood glucose. Clinical studies have found both increased glucose and insulin levels (suggesting insulin resistance) and reduced insulin sensitivity in sleep-deprived individuals. [11] Disruption in the regulation of appetite hormones as seen with higher ghrelin and lower leptin levels may lead to increased food intake and weight gain, also increasing the risk of insulin resistance. [11]\nSome people who have insufficient sleep have a condition called obstructive sleep apnea, which blocks breathing in the upper airway tubes, often because of increased fat in the tongue. Sleep apnea is independently associated with insulin resistance; a lack of oxygen while sleeping can cause oxidative stress and inflammation that are believed to progress toward insulin resistance. [11]",
        "ac2f12b3-2449-4aef-9269-f10af7b719db": "Cardiovascular disease\nBoth shorter and longer sleep durations are associated with cardiovascular diseases. [12,13] Proposed reasons include activation of the sympathetic nervous system and impaired endothelial function, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and hardening of arteries. There may also be greater release of pro-inflammatory cells and decreased immune function. Metabolic changes include a disruption in appetite hormones and circadian rhythms that lead to inflammatory conditions. [14]\n\nPeople sleeping less than 6 hours a night, particularly women, were 20-32% more likely to develop hypertension compared with those sleeping 7-8 hours a night. [12] Having 5 or less hours of sleep a night was associated with double the risk of developing hypertension in another study. [15]\nIn a Nurses\u2019 Health Study, the risk of heart disease was almost 1.4 times higher in women sleeping 5 hours or less a night and 9 hours or more a night compared with those sleeping 8 hours a night. [16]\nIn postmenopausal women, those who slept 5 hours or less or 10 hours or more a night had a 25% and 45% increased risk of heart disease, respectively. [17]\nIndividuals with inadequate sleep as well as long sleep durations showed an increased risk of strokes. [12]\nIndividuals with poor sleep quality or insomnia symptoms are 40% more likely to develop hypertension [18]\nPeople with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for stroke, heart attack, and heart failure.\nA Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association included sleep health as part of its eight measures, \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8,\u201d to assess cardiovascular health. [19] It cites evidence showing that either too short or too long sleep durations are associated with heart disease. Their findings also show that chronically poor sleep is a risk factor for early death, is associated with poor psychological health, and can negatively affect blood pressure, inflammation, and regulation of blood glucose.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression\nPoor sleep and insomnia (an inability to sleep or stay asleep) are associated with depression, especially if the insomnia becomes chronic. [20] Insomnia is also associated with increased likelihood of insomnia relapsing over time. Poor sleep quality can impair functioning, increase fatigue, and lead to mood changes. The reverse is also true in which depressive symptoms of intense sadness or hopelessness can interrupt sleep. Insomnia as well as oversleeping are common signs of clinical depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. [21] Treating the depression may lead to improvements in sleep quality. If there is an underlying medical disorder causing the insomnia such as obstructive sleep apnea or chronic pain, then treatment should address these first.\n\n\n\n\nDementia\nIn 2021, authors of a cohort study sought to tease out the association of early brain changes and sleep changes by including younger patients 50 years of age. They followed 7,959 participants for up to 25 years and found that participants who were between the ages of 50-70 years and slept 6 hours or less a night showed a 30% higher risk of developing dementia in later life, compared with those who slept 7 hours. [40] The association was only slightly weaker when authors controlled for various factors independently associated with dementia like cardiometabolic status (high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, cardiovascular disease), sociodemographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status), health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, intake of fruits and vegetables), and mental health factors (depression). The authors did not find an association with longer sleep durations (8 or more hours) and dementia, though this may have been due to the low number of participants who slept longer durations.\n\n\n\n\nMortality\nProspective cohort studies have found that both a chronic lack of sleep (less than 7 hours) and long sleep durations (more than 8 hours) are associated with greater risk of death from all causes. [7,13] Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are also associated with increased mortality. [22,23]\u00a0However, long sleep durations appear to be more associated with increased risk of mortality than inadequate sleep. [13] Some studies show that women may have greater risk of mortality related to short sleep durations than men. [24] Longer sleep times are associated with several factors that are associated with mortality, including fatigue, stress, obstructive sleep apnea, and increased inflammation of heart arteries. More research with randomized controlled trials is needed to better understand the reasons for these findings.",

More research with randomized controlled trials is needed to better understand the reasons for these findings.\n\n\nMedical Conditions that Interfere with Sleep\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\u2014Symptoms of OSA include snoring or gasping for air that causes interruptions in sleep and prevention of good-quality sleep. Sleep apnea also causes oxygen levels to drop during sleep, which can pose a stress on the heart, brain and other organs. People with OSA may not be aware that they are awakening frequently in the night, but do not get refreshed sleep, feeling excessively sleepy or tired during the day. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices may be prescribed, which provides pressurized air to the nose and throat, preventing the upper airway from collapsing. Another common treatment is dental devices that move the jaw forward and increasing the airway size. Obesity is a risk factor for OSA because carrying extra weight, particularly in the neck area, can contribute to obstructed breathing passages. About 70% of adults with OSA have obesity, and a significant improvement in OSA is seen with weight reduction. [7] OSA is a risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. [7]\nRestless leg syndrome\u2014This condition is associated with discomfort in the legs accompanied by an urge to move, which disrupts sleep. It is believed that abnormal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine may be responsible, so medications are given to correct this. In some cases, low levels of iron can result in this disorder.\nInsomnia\u2014This condition is defined as the inability to sleep or stay asleep. An individual may have a hard time falling asleep, or may sleep but then awaken in the early morning and be unable to return to sleep. Short-term insomnia can be caused by stress or traumatic events (divorce, job loss, death of a loved one). Chronic or long-term insomnia may be caused by ongoing anxiety, working different work shifts that disrupt the body\u2019s circadian rhythms, poor sleep habits, medical conditions that can interrupt sleep (chronic pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease), or medications that have a stimulating effect. Insomnia often can be treated with behavioral therapies, although sometimes sleep medications are prescribed.\nGenetic\u2014Studies have found specific gene variants that are associated with insomnia. [25,26] The same genes for insomnia were also associated with higher levels of body fat, depression, and heart disease. Research has also found that sleep apnea clusters within families, and genes have been identified that appear to increase risk for sleep apnea as well as cardiovascular disease. [27] More research is needed in this area.\n\nWhat if I work the night shift?People who work overnight shifts, early morning shifts, or rotating shifts (both day shifts and night shifts) may develop something called shift work disorder (SWD).  Studies show that those with SWD have poorer sleep quality than day workers. [28] They may take longer to fall asleep, experience insomnia, and feel excessive sleepiness while awake. This is caused by attempts to sleep in daylight, which opposes natural circadian rhythms. Poor sleep hygiene further aggravates the problem. SWD is associated with decreased alertness, higher risk of work-related accidents, and increased depression and anxiety. SWD is also associated with metabolic changes increasing the risk of heart disease, obesity, and digestive problems caused by irregular eating habits or poor diet. The following tips can help if you work nontraditional hours: [29]\n\nRequest to work the same shift several nights in a row, to avoid flipping between day and night shift schedules on consecutive days. This helps to regulate the circadian system.\nCommit to a consistent sleep schedule, darkening the bedroom with blackout shades, and creating a quiet atmosphere as much as possible. You might reduce light exposure even earlier by wearing sunglasses as soon as you leave work. To reduce noise, wear earplugs and use a white noise machine to block sounds.\nAfter finishing a night shift, try to return home and go to bed as soon as possible. Running errands, watching television, talking with family, or exercising can re-energize your body so that falling asleep becomes more difficult.\nAlthough it is tempting to run errands and attend medical appointments during the day when places are less crowded, try to minimize doing them immediately after work so that you can return home and honor your sleep schedule.\nTry to keep a set meal schedule. Do meal planning to ensure that quick easy meals are ready when you arrive home, and bring prepped meals/snacks to work for overnight shifts to prevent reliance on fast food and takeout meals. Try to avoid eating a large meal right before bed, which can increase the risk of reflux and indigestion.",
        "b0e90e7b-6380-4e66-ac37-8f2dc3544a60": "Sleep Deficiency and Eating Behaviors\nEpidemiological studies show that insufficient sleep is independently associated with a higher risk of obesity. Clinical studies of of sleep-restricted adults show an increased hunger and calorie intake when participants are allowed free access to food. [7] A preference for late evening or nighttime food intake and increased snacking has been observed. [9] There also appears to be a food preference for higher carbohydrate and fat foods, which could partly explain the overall higher calorie intake.\nChanges in hormone levels that signal either hunger or satiety have also been observed in clinical sleep restriction studies. Leptin is a hormone associated with satisfaction. When food enters the stomach, leptin is released from fat cells and travels to the brain where it signals the body to stop eating by creating a sensation of fullness. People with obesity may actually have very high levels of leptin; the more body fat one has, the more leptin is produced in fat cells. However, a condition called leptin resistance may occur in which the brain does not receive the usual signal from leptin to stop eating. In response, more and more leptin is released. Lower leptin levels as well as high leptin levels suggesting leptin resistance have been observed in sleep-deprived adults. [7]\nGhrelin, the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d typically has the opposing action of leptin. It is released in the gut and sends hunger signals to the brain when someone is not eating enough. About three hours after eating a meal, ghrelin levels drop. Clinical studies have found that sleep restriction leads to elevated ghrelin levels. [9]\nDespite this interesting theory of poor sleep leading to changes in appetite hormone levels, other studies have found no changes and therefore the association is still inconclusive. [9] Conflicting findings may be due to differences in the study participants (e.g., age, gender) and differences in how the researchers defined the duration and severity of sleep restriction.\nHow Much Sleep Do We Need?\nSleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps. Toddlers need about 10-14 hours a day. Preteens and teenagers need about 8-12 hours a night, and adults about 7-8 hours a day. [30] A consensus by the AASM and Sleep Research Society recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours a night to promote optimal health. [31]\nDespite these general recommendations on sleep duration, individual differences in sleep requirements exist. In most epidemiologic studies, increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, has been observed among those who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per day, and 9 hours or more per day. Thus, a range of sleep hours (more than 5 and less than 9) is considered appropriate for most healthy adults.\nOther factors such as quality of sleep are important, because just meeting the total recommended sleep hours may not be enough if one wakes up frequently in the night. A common belief is that lost sleep from a late night out or studying can be recovered by \u201csleeping in\u201d another day or taking naps. However, both of these methods disrupt the body\u2019s circadian rhythms and may deprive the body of deeper sleep stages. In fact, increased variability in how much sleep we get from night to night is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic and heart diseases. [32] It is important to respond, whenever possible, to the body\u2019s natural signals of sleepiness.\nWhat about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep?Herbal supplements\nTwo popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness. It is well tolerated in adults with few reported adverse events in doses up to 10 mg. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the judicious use of melatonin for certain sleep and circadian disorders such as shift work disorder or jet lag. [33]\nValerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep. However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia.",
        "ae679950-d361-4f05-8eec-7ab720104ff2": "What about supplements, medicines, and other therapies for sleep?Herbal supplements\nTwo popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids.

However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia. The AASM does not recommend valerian for insomnia disorder. [33]\nIt is important to note that supplements are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness. Therefore doses and preparations of these herbs can vary widely. A study of 31 melatonin products found that the melatonin levels in the pills ranged between 83%-478% of the dose reported on the label. [33] More than 70% of the products varied from the labeled dose by more than 10%. If supplements are used, look for a label verifying its quality from a third-party, such as from the U.S. Pharmacopeia.\nSleep medicines\nCommon medicines prescribed for sleep include sedatives such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan*). They help with falling asleep initially, but tend to reduce the amount of deeper sleep. They are not recommended for long-term use because they can worsen insomnia, increase depression, and impair memory, and are associated with increased risk of falls, cancer, and early death. [34] Long-term use of benzodiazepines can promote psychological dependence, and there is a risk of addiction and abuse. [35] Tolerance can also develop over time, requiring larger doses to maintain their effectiveness. Because of these side effects, benzodiazepines are not recommended to treat insomnia in older adults. [35] There are other classes of sleep medications including non-benzodiazepines (e.g., Lunesta, Ambien) and antidepressants (e.g., Zoloft) that also quicken the time to fall asleep but may interfere with deeper sleep stages. Anticholinergic medications (e.g., Benadryl) can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and decline. Generally, sleep medicines are most effective when used occasionally or for a short time of less than one month. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that cognitive behavioral therapy be used as the initial treatment for insomnia. [*The inclusion of brand names is included for reference and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse any specific brands.]\nOther therapies\nRandomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia. [35,33] They have been found more effective than medications for the long-term management of insomnia. People may be asked to keep a sleep journal to record sleep habits and activities performed around bedtime, which can help determine the most appropriate CBT.\n\nSleep Hygiene Tips\u00a0\n\nSet a sleep schedule and stick to it. Try to go to bed at night and awaken in the morning around the same times, even on weekends. This helps to regulate the body\u2019s sleep cycles and circadian rhythms.\nTry to exercise at some point in the day but avoid vigorous activity (running, fast dancing, high-intensity interval training or HIIT) one hour before bedtime. Regular exercise of adequate intensity can promote muscle relaxation and deeper sleep later on.\nTry to avoid large meals, heavy snacking, or alcohol 2-3 hours before bed.\nIf you are sensitive to caffeine, try to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages 4-6 hours before bedtime.\nStop using electronic devices an hour before bed, especially those emitting blue light such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions.\nSchedule before-bed activities to signal that you are winding down, such as changing into pajamas and brushing teeth.\nCreate a quiet, dark, relaxing environment in your bedroom. Dim the lights and turn off your cell phone\u2019s sound and vibration modes if possible.\nEnsure a comfortable temperature, as feeling too hot or cold can disrupt sleep.",

Get up and do quiet relaxing activities, such as reading, until you feel tired enough to fall back asleep. \u00a0\n\nDoes exercising at night disrupt sleep?A solid body of research confirms that both aerobic and resistance exercises improve sleep, with reported improvements comparable to the effects of pharmacological treatments for insomnia if exercises are performed regularly. [36] A review of 13 studies found that regular resistance exercises (using resistance bands, strength machines) performed 2-3 times a week for an average of one hour improved sleep quality. [37] It also found that resistance exercises decreased anxiety and depression, which could be a factor in improving sleep. However, it is not recommended to do vigorous exercises such as running or interval training within one hour of bedtime. A review of 23 studies found that healthy adults who performed high-intensity exercise too soon before bed had difficulty falling asleep and experienced poorer sleep quality. [38] Yet, this study and others did not find that performing more moderate exercises or exercising vigorously further away from bedtime caused sleep disturbances, and in fact helped people to experience increased amounts of deeper sleep.

We may hope for longevity so that we can experience many years of quality time with loved ones or have time to explore the world. But living to a ripe old age doesn\u2019t necessarily mean healthy or happy longevity if it is burdened by disability or disease. The population of people over age 65 has grown more quickly than other age groups due to longer life spans and declining birth rates, and yet people are living more years in poor health. [1] Therefore, we will explore not just one\u2019s lifespan but healthspan, which promotes more healthy years of life.\nWhat you do today can transform your healthspan or how you age in the future. Although starting early is ideal, it\u2019s never too late to reap benefits.\nFive Key Lifestyle Factors\nResearchers from Harvard University looked at factors that might increase the chances of a longer life. [2] Using data collected from men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were followed for up to 34 years, researchers identified five low-risk lifestyle factors: healthy diet, regular exercise (at least 30 minutes daily of moderate to vigorous activity), healthy weight (as defined by a body mass index of 18.5-24.9), no smoking, and moderate alcohol intake (up to 1 drink daily for women, and up to 2 daily for men). Compared with those who did not incorporate any of these lifestyle factors, those with all five factors lived up to 14 years longer.\nIn a follow-up study, the researchers found that those factors might contribute to not just a longer but also a healthier life. [2] They saw that women at age 50 who practiced four or five of the healthy habits listed above lived about 34 more years free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, compared with 24 more disease-free years in women who practiced none of these healthy habits. Men practicing four or five healthy habits at age 50 lived about 31 years free of chronic disease, compared with 24 years among men who practiced none. Men who were current heavy smokers, and men and women with obesity, had the lowest disease-free life expectancy.\nFive factors for a longer and healthier lifespan\n\nHealthy diet \u2013 The prevalence of hypertension (high blood pressure) and dementia increases with age. Eating patterns such as those from the DASH, MIND, and Mediterranean diets can lower the risk of these and other chronic conditions that accompany older ages. A multivitamin-mineral supplement may also help to improve cognitive function and memory in some people, according to large randomized controlled trials.\nRegular exercise \u2013 Regular physical activity lowers the risk of several chronic conditions that increase with age including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and cognitive decline. Exercise also helps to lower anxiety and blood pressure, and improve sleep quality. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first recommends to move more and sit less, with some activity better than none. For additional health benefits, they advise a minimum of 150-300 minutes weekly of moderate to vigorous activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, as well as two days a week of muscle-strengthening exercises. Older adults who are at risk for falls may also wish to include balance training such as tai chi or yoga. See additional physical activity considerations for older adults.\u00a0\nHealthy weight \u2013 Determining one\u2019s healthy weight range is unique for each person. Factors to consider include reviewing current health conditions, family history, weight history, and genetically inherited body type. Rather than focusing on scale weight alone, monitoring an increase in harmful visceral \u201cbelly fat\u201d and weight change since age 20 may be useful.\nNot smoking \u2013 Smoking is a strong risk factor for cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, and earlier death as it promotes chronic inflammation and oxidative stress (a condition that can damage cells and tissues). [2] Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Quitting greatly reduces the risk of these smoking-related diseases. [4]\nModerate alcohol \u2013 Research finds that moderate drinking, defined as 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, and early death from cardiovascular disease. Low to moderate amounts of alcohol raises levels of \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prevent small blood clots that can block arteries. However, because alcohol intake\u2014especially heavier drinking\u2014is also associated with risks of addiction, liver disease, and several types of cancer, it is a complex issue that is best discussed with your physician to weigh your personal risk versus benefit.",
        "a5a453c3-0959-494a-b24a-306cdac38901": "Additional Factors for Healthy Longevity\nBeyond the five core lifestyle habits mentioned above, a growing body of research is identifying additional factors that may be key to increasing our healthspans:\n\nHaving life purpose/meaning. Research shows that having a sense of meaning or purpose in daily life is associated with better sleep, healthier weight, higher physical activity levels, and lower inflammation in some people. [5,6] It also promotes optimism. If people are healthier at older ages, they can potentially contribute more to their family, community, and society as a whole. [1] This translates to being stronger and more mobile to assist younger generations with childcare or other family activities, working beyond retirement age, volunteering for local causes, pursuing pleasurable hobbies, and engaging in community groups. In reciprocation of these activities, people reap a sense of meaning and purpose.\nSocial connections. Studies of adults 50 years and older show that loneliness and social isolation are associated with a higher risk of disease, disability, and mortality. [7-10]\u00a0The U.S. Health and Retirement study comprised of 11,302 older participants found that almost 20% met criteria for loneliness. [7]\u00a0Those who experienced persistent loneliness had a 57% increased risk of early death compared with those who never experienced loneliness; those who were socially isolated had a 28% increased risk. Participants who experienced both loneliness and social isolation showed signs of advanced biological aging (e.g., chronic inflammation that can increase the risk of morbidities). Conversely, people experiencing cognitive decline may have less social contact due to greater difficulty initiating and maintaining social interactions. [11]\nBrain stimulation. Stressing the brain or doing activities that entail strenuous mental effort, such as learning a new skill, language, or exercise format during leisure time may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Research has shown a strong association of attaining higher education and engaging in work that is intellectually demanding with a lower risk of dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and cognitive impairment. [10,12]\nImproving sleep quality. Research is still inconclusive, but some reports suggest that insomnia is associated with higher rates of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline. Chronic disrupted sleep may lead to systemic (throughout the body) inflammation, which is a precursor to the development of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain as found with AD. [13] The reverse can also occur with advanced stages of AD causing disturbed circadian rhythms that regulate sleep. However, a cohort study of 1,629 adults aged 48 to 91 years from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative did not find that sleep disturbance affected cognitive decline in later years. [14]\nIntermittent fasting. Animal research shows that caloric restriction over a lifetime, such as with intermittent fasting, increases lifespan. [15] The body responds to fasting with improved regulation of blood glucose, greater stress resistance, and decreased inflammation and production of damaging free radicals. During fasting, cells remove or repair damaged molecules. [15] These effects may prevent the development of chronic disorders including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurological decline including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. [16] Other effects of intermittent fasting in animals include better balance and coordination, and improved cognition, specifically with memory. Human studies have found improved insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure, decreased LDL cholesterol, and weight loss. [15,17]\u00a0However, human studies and randomized controlled trials on the effects of fasting on aging and longevity are still needed.\n\nHow sensory changes with aging affect how we eatWe know that taste is key when enjoying a meal, but what about the smell, texture, appearance, colorfulness, mouthfeel, and even the sound of food (how it crunches in the mouth or sizzles when cooking)? These are the human senses that contribute to the eating experience and influence our food choices. [18]\nThese senses can decline over time for various reasons: normal aging, which causes a gradual decrease in taste and smell; prescription drugs that reduce taste sensitivity and promote dry mouth or lack of saliva; deficiencies in micronutrients such as zinc that reduce taste; and poor dentition with tooth loss or dentures leading to chewing problems. [19] Up to 60% of adults 70 years and older may lose their sense of taste. [20] With this loss may come heavier seasoning of food with sugar and salt. [21] They may prefer softer lower-fiber foods that don\u2019t require much chewing. Poor taste and smell in the elderly is associated with lower dietary quality and poorer appetite. [22]\nFood aromas are important as they trigger the release of saliva, stomach acid, and enzymes in preparation for digestion.",
        "a7e78523-5efc-4050-9b89-940bd1d352ea": "These are the human senses that contribute to the eating experience and influence our food choices.

[21] They may prefer softer lower-fiber foods that don\u2019t require much chewing. Poor taste and smell in the elderly is associated with lower dietary quality and poorer appetite. [22]\nFood aromas are important as they trigger the release of saliva, stomach acid, and enzymes in preparation for digestion. [23] The scent of food can trigger the release of dopamine and serotonin, causing a feeling of wellbeing to encourage eating. An impaired sense of smell in older adults is also associated with less variety in food choices and poorer nutrition, but can also lead to increased food intake and weight gain in some individuals. [23]\nSeasoning food more liberally with sodium-free herbs, spices, and vinegars may help to compensate for sensory deficiencies. Using foods with a savory umami quality like mushrooms, tomatoes, some cheeses, and yeast can boost richness and flavor. Another sensory aspect of food called \u201ckokumi\u201d describes a full and rich mouthfeel\u2014such as that experienced from a minestrone soup, an aged cheese, or a seafood stew simmering for many hours. If poor appetite from sensory loss is a problem, providing variety through different textures, smells, and colors in the meal may stimulate an increased desire to eat. [21]\nEating and food preparation are also important activities offering socialization and mental stimulation such as when learning new cooking skills. Preparing meals helps to reduce sedentariness as there are several action steps involved: selecting and purchasing, washing and chopping, and cooking the ingredients.\n\nSpotlight on longevity in JapanJapanese women and men currently live five to six years longer than Americans, so their practices are of great interest. In Japanese families, elders are highly revered and households are intergenerational. Japanese elders are generally healthier than Western elders, but is this the chicken or the egg? Does better health from good lifestyle habits allow them to stay physically active and involved in society so they remain a valuable asset and reap psychosocial benefits, or is it the culture that reveres elders so they have better mental health, less loneliness, and better healthcare so that they stay healthier longer? Japan has also largely avoided the epidemic of obesity that the U.S. is experiencing; for example, the prevalence of obesity among U.S. women is about 37% but among Japanese women is less than 5%. [24]\u00a0 This difference is certainly an important contributor to differences in life expectancy, but raises questions about how the Japanese have been able to control their weight. In recent years, diets in Japan have become more similar to those in the U.S. but they still eat smaller portions, more fermented foods, less sweets, and less red meat.\n\nLooking Ahead\nIdentifying additional factors that improve and extend our healthspans is an active area of scientific inquiry. In the meantime, current research findings are encouraging, and underscore the importance of following healthy lifestyle habits throughout one\u2019s life course. That said, sticking to these behaviors is easier said than done, and public policies must support and promote these habits by improving the food and physical environments that surround us.\n\n\nReferences\n\nNational Academy of Medicine. 2022.

Yet many of these chronic diseases are preventable, as they\u2019re linked to poor diet and lifestyle choices including tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and inadequate physical activity.\nThe CDC reports some sobering statistics about Americans:\n\nChronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability.\n70% of annual deaths are due to chronic diseases.\nThese preventable conditions not only compromise quality of life, they add to rising health care costs\u201475% of our health care dollars are devoted to treat these diseases.\nAmong adults ages 20 to 74, diabetes remains the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations.\n\nThe good news is that you have the power to help prevent chronic disease, as making positive diet and lifestyle changes can help reduce risk. Eating healthy foods, getting enough exercise, and refraining from tobacco and excessive alcohol use confer numerous health benefits\u2014including possibly preventing the onset of chronic diseases.\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Heart disease afflicts or kills as many as one in two adults in the United States and other developed countries. [1]\nTypes\nTwo harmful internal processes underlie most forms of heart disease:\n\nAtherosclerosis:\u00a0atherosclerosis is the accumulation of cholesterol-filled plaque in the inner walls of an artery. It is usually accompanied by low-grade inflammation. Atherosclerosis is a slow-growing, generally silent condition that plays a key role in many types of heart disease. It can begin during teenage years, or even earlier. Atherosclerosis first appears as whitish streaks on the inner lining of artery walls. As more and more\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0enters the artery wall, these fatty streaks turn into plaques\u2014pockets of cholesterol, white blood cells, and more. Plaque can bulge outward into the bloodstream, or inward away from the bloodstream. Large plaques can narrow the opening available for blood flow, causing chest pain, or angina, during physical exertion or stress. Large and small plaques can rupture, creating a blood clot that, if too large, can completely block blood flow in the vessels, causing a heart attack or stroke.\nEndothelial dysfunction:\u00a0the endothelium is the layer of tissue that lines the inside of arteries. A healthy endothelium works to keep an artery free from plaque or blood clots. It also allows the artery to easily widen and narrow to regulate blood flow. Smoking, high blood pressure, and other \u201cinsults\u201d can cause the endothelium to malfunction. Endothelial dysfunction harms health directly and also contributes to atherosclerosis.\n\nAtherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction\u00a0can be prevented. Halting them once they\u2019ve started, or reversing them, is possible too, but is much harder to achieve. Atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction can lead to a variety of conditions:\n\nCoronary artery disease: atherosclerosis in one or more arteries that nourish the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease underlies:\n\nAngina:\u00a0chest pain or discomfort with exertion or stress. Angina occurs when the heart\u2019s demand for oxygen (because it is working harder) outstrips the coronary arteries\u2019 abilities to supply part of the heart with enough oxygenated blood.\nHeart attack:\u00a0the complete blockage of blood flow through an artery, which prevents part of the heart muscle from receiving any oxygenated blood. Such blockages occur when a plaque ruptures and a clot forms to seal the break. If the clot is large enough, it can completely block the blood vessel. A clot can also break away and lodge in a smaller artery.",
        "655b31f7-c862-4850-8423-ac8812ecb039": "Stroke:\u00a0essentially a brain attack. Most strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery feeding part of the brain (these are called ischemic strokes). Without a constant supply of oxygen, brain cells rapidly die. About 20% of strokes occur when a blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain (these are called hemorrhagic strokes).\nHeart failure:\u00a0the inability of the heart to pump blood through the body as efficiently as it should. This prevents other organs from getting as much oxygenated blood as they need to carry out their functions\nHeart arrhythmias:\u00a0potentially harmful changes in the rhythm of the heartbeat. They include ventricular fibrillation, which nearly always causes death, and atrial fibrillation, which causes fatigue and increases the risk of stroke.\nValve disorders:\u00a0four valves inside the heart ensure a one-way flow of blood through the heart and around the body. Corrosion of a valve can cause it to leak, which makes the heart work harder. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath or lead to heart failure.\nPeripheral artery disease:\u00a0atherosclerosis-induced reductions in circulation to the arms, legs, kidneys, digestive system, and other parts of the body.\nCognitive decline:\u00a0age-related memory loss and decline in thinking abilities. Although it is usually blamed on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a common cause is poor blood flow to the brain through atherosclerosis-narrowed arteries.\n\nThe American Heart Association estimates that around 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of heart disease or the after-effects of stroke. [2] It\u2019s also the number one cause of death globally: more people die annually from cardiovascular diseases than from any other cause. [3]\nRisk Factors\nSeveral factors influence your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, or developing another form of heart disease. Some of these you can\u2019t change; some you can:\n\nNon-modifiable risk factors (risk factors you can\u2019t change) include:\u00a0age, gender, genes, and ethnic origin.\u00a0There\u2019s also strong evidence that your early development in the womb and during childhood helps set the stage for heart health or heart disease.\nRisk factors that\u00a0can\u00a0be modified include\u00a0habits and choices\u00a0such as:\u00a0tobacco use, physical activity, and\u00a0what you eat and drink.\n\nOther potentially modifiable risk factors include air pollution, noise, stress, and infection, though these are not as easy for an individual to control directly.",
        "e73abd2d-c5cf-4bf0-86b2-b28f3ad93af4": "And all of the above affect physiologic factors like blood pressure, cholesterol level, and blood sugar.\nHaving a risk factor doesn\u2019t automatically mean you will develop heart disease. But the more of them you have, the higher your odds\u2014unless you take action.\nCalculating risk\nSeveral models have been developed to help individuals predict their risk of having a heart attack or developing heart disease. The American Heart Association has endorsed the use of these models in the primary prevention setting. [4]\n\nMy Life Check is an online health assessment tool created by the American Heart Association that encourages forming habits that will promote heart health. Based on answers to the questionnaire, one will receive recommendations, ability to log goals, and track one\u2019s progress. It requires you to create a username and password, but is a free service.\nThe Reynolds Risk Score is a validated tool developed from the Women\u2019s Health Study and Physicians Health Study that predicts the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or heart disease in the next 10 years, accounting for age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol, family history, and C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation.\nThe ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus is a calculator developed by the American College of Cardiology for healthcare providers to estimate the 10-year risk of an initial heart attack or stroke in patients who are 40-79 years of age, accounting for age, sex, race, cholesterol, blood pressure, and disease history. It then outlines treatment guidelines with lifestyle changes and/or medication.\n\nThese calculators are useful for estimating the risk of developing heart disease among individuals who already have strong risk factors and who are at high risk for having a heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event. However, these calculators may underestimate the true lifetime burden of heart disease, especially in middle-aged adults, as more than half of all such cardiovascular events occur in individuals who aren\u2019t classified as high risk. [5] In addition, while most American adults have low\u00a0short-term risk\u00a0of heart disease, two-thirds of them have a high\u00a0lifetime risk. [6]\nPrevention Is Possible\nAlthough some types of heart disease have an unknown cause or are inherited at birth, the good news is that the most\u00a0common conditions\u00a0like heart attacks, strokes, and high blood pressure can be largely prevented by\u00a0making healthy dietary and lifestyle choices.\n\nCompelling data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study show that women who followed a healthy lifestyle pattern were 80% less likely to develop coronary artery disease over a 14-year period compared to all other women in the study. [7]\nIn a companion study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, men also reaped similar benefits from making healthy choices. [8]\nA healthy lifestyle pattern may prevent more than 50% of deaths due to ischemic strokes,[9] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [10] and 75% of all deaths due to cardiovascular disease.

[1]\u00a0All three have similar elements, but different starting times and different effects.\n\n Secondary prevention. These efforts are started after someone has a heart attack or stroke, undergoes angioplasty or bypass surgery, or develops some other form of heart disease. It involves taking medications like aspirin and/or a cholesterol-lowering statin, quitting smoking and losing weight if needed, exercising more, and following a healthy diet. Although secondary prevention may sound like \u201cclosing the barn door after the horse has gone,\u201d it isn\u2019t. These steps can prevent a second heart attack or stroke, halt the progression of heart disease, and prevent early death. It may be obvious, but the number one killer of individuals who survive a first heart attack is a second heart attack.\n Primary prevention. Primary prevention aims to keep an individual at risk of heart disease from having a first heart attack or stroke, needing angioplasty or surgery, or developing some other form of heart disease. Primary prevention is usually aimed at people who already have developed cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. As with secondary prevention, primary prevention focuses on controlling these risk factors by making healthy lifestyle changes and, if needed, taking medications. That said, the appearance of worrisome cardiovascular risk factors means that inflammation, atherosclerosis, and/or endothelial dysfunction are already at work and, in most cases, aren\u2019t reversible.\n Primordial prevention. The word \u201cprimordial\u201d means existing from the beginning. Primordial prevention involves working to prevent inflammation, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction from taking hold, and thus prevent risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, excess weight, and ultimately cardiovascular events. Once rarely discussed, primordial prevention is now the cornerstone of the American Heart Association\u2019s definition of ideal heart health and efforts to help people achieve it. [1]\u00a0As its name implies, the sooner you can start practicing primordial prevention\u2014ideally from childhood on\u2014the more likely you are to achieve it and protect yourself from heart disease.\n\nSteps for the primordial prevention of heart disease\nFive key lifestyle steps can dramatically reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately heart disease:\n1. Not smoking\nOne of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease.",

Not smoking\nOne of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease.\nIn fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2]\n\nThis study also reported that much of the excess risk due to smoking may be drastically lowered after quitting. Additionally, the excess risk for all-cause mortality\u2014that is, death from any cause\u2014decreases to the level of a \u201cnever-smoker\u201d 20 years after quitting.\n\nThe nicotine that tobacco products deliver is one of the most addictive substances around. That makes tobacco use one of the toughest unhealthy habits to break. But don\u2019t get discouraged; many smokers do quit! In fact, in the United States today there are more ex-smokers than smokers. [3]\u00a0Learn more about the hazards of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and tips for quitting from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n2. Maintaining a healthy weight\nExcess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well as a host of other health problems. [4-6]\nIn a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7]\nIn the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer.\n\nThose who gained more than 22 pounds had an even greater risk of developing these diseases. [4,8-11]\n\nWeight and height go hand-in-hand. The taller you are, the more you weigh. That\u2019s why researchers have devised several measures that account for both weight and height. The one most commonly used is BMI.\n\nYou can calculate your BMI by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m2). You can also use an online BMI calculator or BMI table.\nA healthy BMI is under 25 kg/m2. Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2\nWaist size matters, too. In people who are not overweight, waist size may be an even more telling warning sign of increased health risks than BMI. [12]\u00a0An expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health identified these useful benchmarks: Men should aim for a waist size below 40 inches (102 cm) and women should aim for a waist size below 35 inches (88 cm). [13]\n\n3. Exercising\nExercise and physical activity are excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions, [14-16] but many of us get less activity as we get older.\n\nGetting regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your health. It lowers the risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, and it can also help control stress, improve sleep, boost mood, keep weight in check, and reduce the risk of falling and improve cognitive function in older adults.\nIt doesn\u2019t take marathon training to see real health gains. A 30-minute brisk walk five days of the week will provide important benefits for most people. Getting any amount of exercise is better than none.\nExercise and physical activity benefit the body, while a sedentary lifestyle does the opposite\u2014increasing the chances of becoming overweight and developing a number of chronic diseases.\nResearch shows that people who spend more time each day watching television, sitting, or riding in cars have a greater chance of dying early than people who are more active.",

[17-19]\u00a0A 2013 study showed that, among women ages 50-79 with no cardiovascular disease at the start of study, prolonged sitting time was associated with increased heart disease risk regardless of the amount of time spent in leisure-time physical activity. [16]\n\n4. Following a healthy diet\nFor years, research into connections between diet and heart disease focused on individual nutrients like cholesterol (and foods high in dietary cholesterol, like eggs), types of fats, and specific vitamins and minerals. This work has been revealing, but it has also generated some dead ends, along with myths and confusion about what constitutes a heart-healthy diet. That\u2019s because people eat food, not nutrients.\n\nThe best diet for preventing heart disease is one that is full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish, poultry, and vegetable oils; includes alcohol in moderation, if at all; and goes easy on red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates, foods and beverages with added sugar, sodium, and foods with trans fat.\nPeople with diets consistent with this dietary pattern had a 31% lower risk of heart disease, a 33% lower risk of diabetes, and a 20% lower risk of stroke. [20]\nA randomized controlled trial found that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, both rich sources of unsaturated fat, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with cardiovascular disease over a 4.8-year follow-up period.\n\nThis study highlighted that low-fat diets are not beneficial to heart health, and that incorporating healthy fats \u2013 such as those included in the Mediterranean diet \u2013\u00a0 can improve heart health and weight loss.\nThere isn\u2019t one exact Mediterranean diet, as this eating style takes into account the different foods, eating patterns, and lifestyles in multiple countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are similarities that define a Mediterranean eating pattern, including: high intake of olive oil, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and cereals; moderate intake of fish and poultry; low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets; and wine in moderation, consumed with meals. [21]\n\n\nA 2020 study focused on dietary scores for 4 healthy eating patterns: Healthy Eating Index\u20132015 ; Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score; Healthful Plant-Based Diet Index; and Alternate Healthy Eating Index. Despite different scoring methods, each of these patterns emphasizes higher intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts, and lower intakes of red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\nThe study found that those who adhered most to healthy eating patterns had a 14% to 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with those who adhered least. The findings also showed that these different healthy eating patterns were similarly effective at lowering risk across racial and ethnic groups and other subgroups studied, and that they were statistically significantly associated with lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke. [22]",

The findings also showed that these different healthy eating patterns were similarly effective at lowering risk across racial and ethnic groups and other subgroups studied, and that they were statistically significantly associated with lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke. [22]\n\n\nSodium and potassium are two interrelated minerals that play major roles in regulating blood pressure and a healthy heart. Eating less salty foods and more potassium-rich foods may significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. [29]\u00a0Potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy. But the reverse of eating a lot of sodium-rich foods especially from processed breads, packaged snacks, canned goods, and fast-food meals while skimping on potassium can increase cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n5. Improving sleep health\nResearch has shown that sleep is an essential component of cardiovascular health.\n\nSleeping for too short or too long a stretch is associated with heart disease and can negatively affect other heart-related risk factors like dietary intake, exercise, weight, blood pressure, and inflammation. [30]\nThere are various reasons causing poor sleep, including clinical sleep disorders, working overnight shifts, or poor sleep hygiene. Talk with your doctor if you have frequent restless nights or do not feel adequately rested during the day. Improving sleep habits can make a difference. Examples include setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it, having a calming bedtime ritual like doing stretches or meditating, getting regular exercise, stopping use of electronic devices an hour before bedtime, and avoiding heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol several hours before bed.\n\nOther factors to consider\nAlong with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. Learn more at the American Heart Association\u2019s \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8.\u201d\nSupportive policy changeDespite the power of individual behavior change, it must be noted that unfavorable eating patterns are driven by a variety of biological, social, economic, and psychological factors. This is acknowledged in a 2018 review paper, which recommends that \u201cgovernments should focus on cardiovascular disease as a global threat and enact policies that will reach all levels of society and create a food environment wherein healthy foods are accessible, affordable, and desirable.\u201d [23] The central illustration of the paper (below) highlights several policy strategies that may help boost healthy eating, such as improving nutrition labels, regulating food marketing, and promoting healthy school and work environments.\n\nReprinted from Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Vol 72, Issue 8, E Yu, VS Malik, FB Hu, Cardiovascular Disease Prevention by Diet Modification: JACC Health Promotion Series, 914-926, 2018, with permission from Elsevier.\n\nPutting it all together\nYou can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits:\n\nDon\u2019t smoke (or quit if you do)\nMaintain a healthy weight\nExercise; be active\nFollow a healthy diet\nImprove sleep health\n\nStrong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.\n\n\nReferences\n\nLloyd-Jones DM, Hong Y, Labarthe D, et al.

The body has intricate mechanisms in place to make sure glucose levels in the blood don\u2019t go too low or soar too high. When you eat, most digestible carbohydrates are converted into glucose and quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. Any rise in blood sugar signals the pancreas to make and release the hormone insulin, which instructs cells to sponge up glucose. Without insulin, glucose floats around the bloodstream, unable to slip inside the cells that need it for energy.\nDiabetes mellitus is a condition of abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood because either the body is not making enough insulin or can\u2019t properly use the insulin it makes. Normally, blood glucose rises after eating a meal but then drops in 1-2 hours as the glucose is shuttled out of the blood and into cells. In people with diabetes, their blood glucose may remain elevated for several hours. Their blood glucose may also rise much higher after eating a meal than someone who does not have diabetes.",
        "e786df2a-4911-4a2a-8f98-dd8cb112553e": "What is hypoglycemia?\nThere is much attention on high blood sugar or hyperglycemia, which occurs with all forms of diabetes. But there also exists a condition of too low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can occur from not eating enough food, waiting too long to eat a meal or snack, eating an imbalanced diet that does not contain enough carbohydrate, or exercising more intensely than usual. Sometimes eating too many refined carbohydrates (white bread and pasta, cookies, soda) without also including other foods like protein and vegetables can lead to hypoglycemia because this can quickly spike blood sugar; in response the pancreas may produce too much insulin to help lower the blood sugar quickly, causing a \u201csugar crash.\u201d If a person is taking insulin or using certain oral medications that cause the body to secrete more insulin, they are at higher risk of experiencing hypoglycemia if they are not eating at consistent meal times or an adequate amount of carbohydrate.\nHypoglycemia is diagnosed with a blood sugar level of 70 mg/dL or less. Mild to moderate symptoms include shaking, sweating, dizziness, irregular heart rates, irritability, and confusion. These symptoms are usually corrected by taking a small portion of quick-digesting carbohydrate such as 4 ounces of juice or soda, glucose tablets, or a tablespoon of sugar or honey.\nSevere symptoms are rare and typically occur only in people with type 1 diabetes who are using insulin. These include seizures, unconsciousness, or such disorientation that the person is unable to eat, drink, or call for help. Anyone with type 1 diabetes should wear a medical alert bracelet indicating that they have diabetes. They may also wish to keep a glucagon emergency kit nearby and teach family members, friends, and coworkers how to give a glucagon injection, which will quickly raise their blood sugar.  \n\n\nThere are different types of diabetes, including prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes, and gestational diabetes. The most common types in the U.S. are prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, which are largely influenced by carrying excess body fat, a poor diet, and lack of exercise.\nAlmost 30 million Americans have diabetes; of those, about 7 million don\u2019t know they have the disease. [1] About 84 million adults have a condition called prediabetes that is a precursor to full-blown diabetes. In 2017, the total estimated cost of diagnosed cases of diabetes in the U.S. was $327 billion including direct medical costs and reduced productivity. (1) If the spread of type 2 diabetes continues at its present rate, the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the United States will increase to about 48 million in 2050. [2] Worldwide, the number of adults with diabetes will rise to 439 million in the year 2030. [3]\nSecondary health problems stemming from diabetes are equally alarming. High blood glucose levels can damage organs and tissues. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and kidney failure among adults. It causes mild to severe nerve damage that, coupled with diabetes-related circulation problems, often leads to the loss of a leg or foot. Diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and strokes. It is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., directly causing almost 80,000 deaths each year and contributing to thousands more. [1,4,5]\nTypes of Diabetes",
        "48dff4d2-e39a-490f-a7ea-c3a271a0162b": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus\nType 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes) is an autoimmune condition in which immune cells attack and permanently disable the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. It has also been called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes because it was once believed that only children developed this form and that insulin was only used for type 1 diabetes. These terms are now inaccurate because it is possible for older adults to develop type 1 diabetes (called type 1 diabetes onset in adults), and people with later stages of type 2 diabetes sometimes require insulin.\nInsulin is a hormone that shuttles glucose out of the bloodstream and into cells to be used for energy. If the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, blood glucose levels may continue to rise to a dangerous level. This is why people with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin.\nAbout 5% of all people who have diabetes have type 1 diabetes. [6] It is diagnosed by the presence of two or more diabetes-specific antibodies in the blood. It is possible that a person may have these antibodies but not show any symptoms in the early stages. Although having a close family member with type 1 diabetes is a strong risk factor, about 85% of people with type 1 diabetes have no known family history of the disease. [7] type 1 diabetes may also develop after an injury to or surgical removal of the pancreas, or after a viral infection such as measles or polio. For reasons not clearly understood, children who develop type 1 diabetes require insulin treatment much sooner and quicker than adults who develop the disease.\u00a0\nRisk factors for type 1 diabetes:\nType 1 diabetes is believed to be caused by an immune reaction in which the body attacks itself by mistake. Therefore, risk factors are less understood than other types of diabetes. The following may place one at higher risk:\n\nHaving a first (parent, brother, sister) or second-degree relative (uncle, aunt, cousin) with type 1 diabetes increases the risk by up to 15 times. [7]\nYounger age, as type 1 diabetes is more likely to be diagnosed as a child, teenager, or young adult\nIn the U.S., those who are White are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than those who are Black and Hispanic/Latino.\n\nReducing risk\u2014an active research area:\nBecause this diabetes type is an autoimmune disease, researchers are seeking to discover medications that might alter the immune system so that it does not attack and destroy the insulin-producing beta cells. Another main focus is earlier genetic screening to better determine who is at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes, and if one has any residual production of insulin. If physicians can catch those at high risk even before they have developed the autoimmunity, they may be able to intervene to preserve beta cell function.\nIt is believed that there may be environmental factors that trigger the immune system to begin attacking beta cells. Research in this area is active but still inconclusive, with possible dietary factors including cow\u2019s milk proteins, vitamin D deficiency, and omega-3 fatty acid deficiency. Other factors being investigated are viral infections, increasing obesity rates, psychosocial stress, and the gut microbiome. [11] Though people with type 1 diabetes have traditionally been thought to be at lower weights, current research shows that the prevalence of obesity has increased at a faster rate in those with type 1 diabetes compared with the general population. [12] Currently, around 50% of people with type 1 diabetes are either overweight or obese.\nThere are numerous study groups actively researching the prevention of type 1 diabetes. One of the largest is the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group, an international network of physicians and scientists working in 25 clinical centers who are researching ways to prevent, delay, and reverse the progression of type 1 diabetes by preserving insulin production before and after diagnosis.",
        "9bf181ea-7282-4d45-b5d2-70c75ecbfdd9": "Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)\nLatent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a subtype of type 1 diabetes. It has been called \u201ctype 1.5 diabetes\u201d because it is an autoimmune form like type 1 diabetes but develops more slowly like type 2 diabetes. [9] With both type 1 diabetes and LADA, the cells of the pancreas that make insulin stop working. But LADA progresses more slowly than type 1 diabetes so that insulin medication may not be needed for up to several years after being diagnosed. If a person with LADA is still making some insulin, healthy lifestyle changes might delay its progression. However, if the disease progresses so that they produce less or no insulin, they will likely require insulin medication.\nBecause people with LADA are often able to produce some insulin at younger ages, they are typically not diagnosed until an adult, usually after age 30. However, because of their older age at diagnosis, they may be misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes (even though they do not have insulin resistance, and may be at a normal weight, eat a healthful diet, and exercise, which is not typical for an individual who has type 2 diabetes).\nLADA is diagnosed by the presence of antibodies, diabetes diagnosis at a later age, no family history of type 2 diabetes, and a progressive increase in insulin needs. If someone diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is having increasing difficulty controlling the diabetes with oral medications and healthy lifestyle changes alone, he or she may wish to be screened for LADA.\n\n\n\n\nGestational diabetes mellitus\nGestational diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes) is a condition of high blood sugar levels during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy usually occurring around the 24th week. Up to 25% of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes. [10] Women may develop gestational diabetes even if they did not have diabetes prior to pregnancy. There are health risks for women with gestational diabetes: pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy), caesarean section, and risk of larger than normal babies, which can increase the risk of complications during delivery.\nIn many cases, gestational diabetes resolves after the baby is born, although the mother is at 67% higher risk of developing it again in future pregnancies. She is also at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes at some point in the future. Gestational diabetes is believed to be caused by the development of insulin resistance, in which the mother produces insulin but the hormone does not work properly. It is unclear why some pregnant women develop insulin resistance and others do not, but being overweight or obese prior to pregnancy increases the risk of developing gestational diabetes.\nRisk factors for gestational diabetes:\n\nHad gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy\nHaving given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds\nOverweight or obese (body mass index of 25 or higher) prior to pregnancy\n25 years of age or older\nFamily history of type 2 diabetes\nHaving a hormone disorder called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nIn the U.S., being African American, Hispanic/Latino American, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\n\nReducing risk; treatment: \nThe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says that losing extra weight and increasing physical activity before becoming pregnant can lower the risk of developing gestational diabetes. These lifestyle changes can improve how the body uses insulin and help blood glucose levels to stay normal. A Cochrane review looking at lifestyle changes during pregnancy found moderate evidence that both healthy diet and exercise reduced the risk of gestational diabetes and caesarean section when compared with standard care (no special exercise or diet). [10]\nIt is important to control blood glucose levels during pregnancy, because any extra glucose travels through the placenta to the baby. The baby\u2019s body may then produce extra insulin in response to the excess glucose. If the baby does not need the extra glucose for energy, it will be stored as fat, which is why babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes tend to be larger than average. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes have a higher chance of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.\nGestational diabetes is treated with special meal plans, physical activity, and sometimes insulin injections. Healthy lifestyle changes in the long-term can help prevent type 2 diabetes from developing after pregnancy.",
        "946e0e96-7939-447a-b956-97aff5650c73": "Prediabetes\nPrediabetes is an early warning sign that exhibits itself through moderately elevated blood sugar levels, sometimes called \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance.\u201d Prediabetes almost always precedes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes usually do not have any symptoms, so the condition is only discovered if their doctors check their blood glucose. Prediabetes is diagnosed if one\u2019s blood glucose reading is 100-125 mg/dL after fasting for at least 8 hours (normal range is less than 100). More than one-third of the U.S. population, or 84 million people, has prediabetes. [4,5]\nRisk factors for prediabetes\n\nOverweight or obese (body mass index of 25 or higher)\n45 years of age or older\nHaving a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes\nPhysically active less than 3 times a week\nHistory of gestational diabetes or having given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds\nIn the U.S., being African American, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino American, American Indian, or Alaska Native\n\nPrevention\nRecommendations to prevent this early stage of diabetes are similar to those for type 2 diabetes: weight loss of 5-10% of starting weight if overweight, exercise, and a healthful, balanced diet. Learn more about taking steps to prevent diabetes.\n\n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes) is the most common form of diabetes. It begins when muscles and other cells stop responding to insulin\u2019s open-up-for-glucose signal. The body responds by making more and more insulin to help move glucose out of the blood, but eventually exhausting the insulin-producing cells until they burn out. Although genetic mutations may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, environmental factors are a more likely contributor to the insulin not working properly. These factors include excessive weight gain, a diet high in refined carbohydrate and saturated fats, and a sedentary lifestyle. It is also unclear if a family history of type 2 diabetes caused by genetic mutations contributes to future generations developing the disease, or if it is more a matter of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors passed down to children.\nSymptoms of long-term poorly controlled blood glucose or undiagnosed diabetes include frequent urination (excess sugar passes through the kidneys, which creates more urine to remove it from the body), increased thirst, and unintentional weight loss as the glucose from food passes out of the body unabsorbed. Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed if one\u2019s blood glucose reading is 126 mg/dL or higher after fasting for at least 8 hours.\nRisk factors for type 2 diabetes\n\nHaving prediabetes\nOverweight or obese (body mass index of 25 or higher)\n45 years of age or older\nHaving a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes\nCarrying more genetic variants predisposing to type 2 diabetes\nSedentary lifestyle\nUnhealthy diets\nCertain medications such as steroids and statins\nHistory of gestational diabetes or having given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds\nIn the U.S., being African American, Hispanic/Latino American, American Indian, or Alaska Native\n\n\n\nType 2 Diabetes (and Prediabetes) Can Be Prevented\nType 2 diabetes, once called adult-onset diabetes, is striking an ever-growing number of adults. Even more alarming, it is now showing up in teenagers and children. With the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nIn the U.S., the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study found that type 2 diabetes accounted for only 6% of new diabetes cases in non-Hispanic white children ages 10 to 19, but anywhere from 22-76% of new cases in other ethnic groups [8]. The highest rates were found in Asia-Pacific Islander and Native American youth.",

The highest rates were found in Asia-Pacific Islander and Native American youth.\n\n\n\nAlthough the genes you inherit may influence the development of type 2 diabetes, they take a back seat to behavioral and lifestyle factors. Data from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study suggest that 90% of type 2 diabetes in women can be attributed to five such factors: excess weight, lack of exercise, a less-than-healthy diet, smoking, and abstaining from alcohol. [13]\n\nAmong 85,000 married female nurses, 3,300 developed type 2 diabetes over a 16-year period. Women in the low-risk group were 90% less likely to have developed diabetes than the rest of the women. Low-risk meant a healthy weight (body mass index less than 25), a healthy diet, 30 minutes or more of exercise daily, no smoking, and having about three alcoholic drinks per week.\nSimilar factors are at work in men. Data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study indicate that a \u201cWestern\u201d diet, combined with lack of physical activity and excess weight, dramatically increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in men. [14]\n\nInformation from several clinical trials strongly supports the idea that type 2 diabetes is preventable.\n\nThe Diabetes Prevention Program examined the effect of weight loss and increased exercise on the development of type 2 diabetes among men and women with high blood sugar readings that hadn\u2019t yet crossed the line to diabetes. In the group assigned to weight loss and exercise, there were 58% fewer cases of diabetes after almost three years than in the group assigned to usual care. [15] Even after the program to promote lifestyle changes ended, the benefits persisted: The risk of diabetes was reduced, albeit to a lesser degree, over 10 years. [16]\nSimilar results were seen in a Finnish study of weight loss, exercise, and dietary change, and in a Chinese study of exercise and dietary change. [17\u201320]\n\nIs diabetes reversible?Is it possible to reverse or cure diabetes? The answer is maybe. When someone reports that they have \u201creversed\u201d their diabetes, this actually means that they were able to stop using diabetes medication after making healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, following a healthful diet, and exercising. If prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes is detected early in an individual who immediately initiates healthy lifestyle changes, it may be possible to reverse or at least stop the progression of the disease.\nHowever, if these types of diabetes are not diagnosed early or are not well-controlled for a long period, the cells of the pancreas can become permanently damaged so that they no longer produce insulin. If this happens, chances are higher that diet and exercise alone may no longer be effective in controlling the diabetes and lifelong medication may be needed. The same is true with type 1 diabetes and LADA, in which the pancreas already does not make enough insulin. With these conditions, the diabetes can be managed but not reversed.\nThe good news is that type 2 diabetes (as well as prediabetes) are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by healthy lifestyle practices, including controlling your weight, following a healthy diet, staying active, and not smoking.\nSteps to preventing type 2 diabetes\n\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association.

This difficult disease is striking an ever-growing number of adults, and with the rising rates of childhood obesity, it has become more common in youth, especially among certain ethnic groups (learn more about diabetes, including the other types and risk factors).\nThe good news is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are largely preventable. About 9 in 10 cases in the U.S. can be avoided by making lifestyle changes. These same changes can also lower the chances of developing heart disease and some cancers. The key to prevention can be boiled down to five words: Stay lean and stay active.\nWhat if I already have diabetes? Guidelines for preventing or lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes are also appropriate if you currently have a diabetes diagnosis. Achieving a healthy weight, eating a balanced carbohydrate-controlled diet, and getting regular exercise all help to improve blood glucose control. If you are taking insulin medication, you may need more or less carbohydrate at a meal or snack to ensure a healthy blood glucose range. There may also be special dietary needs for exercise, such as bringing a snack so that your blood glucose does not drop too low. For specific guidance on scenarios such as these, refer to your diabetes care team who are the best resources for managing your type of diabetes.\nSimple steps to lowering your risk\nControl your weight\nExcess weight is the single most important cause of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes seven-fold. Being obese makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone with a healthy weight. [1]\nLosing weight can help if your weight is above the healthy-weight range. Losing 7-10% of your current weight can cut your chances of developing type 2 diabetes in half.\nGet moving\u2014and turn off the television\nInactivity promotes type 2 diabetes. [2] Working your muscles more often and making them work harder improves their ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. This puts less stress on your insulin-making cells. So trade some of your sit-time for fit-time.\nLong bouts of hot, sweaty exercise aren\u2019t necessary to reap this benefit. Findings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study suggest that walking briskly for a half hour every day reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30%. [3,4] More recently, The Black Women\u2019s Health Study reported similar diabetes-prevention benefits for brisk walking of more than 5 hours per week. [5] This amount of exercise has a variety of other benefits as well. And even greater cardiovascular and other advantages can be attained by more, and more intense, exercise.\nTelevision-watching appears to be an especially-detrimental form of inactivity: Every two hours you spend watching TV instead of pursuing something more active increases the chances of developing diabetes by 20%; it also increases the risk of heart disease (15%) and early death (13%). [6] The more television people watch, the more likely they are to be overweight or obese, and this seems to explain part of the TV viewing-diabetes link. The unhealthy diet patterns associated with TV watching may also explain some of this relationship.\nTune Up Your Diet\nFour dietary changes can have a big impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes.",
        "96bec9f9-d3ec-4c2c-84e2-cfe5d9378b1f": "1. Choose whole grains and whole grain products over refined grains and other highly processed carbohydrates.\n\nThere is convincing evidence that diets rich in whole grains protect against diabetes, whereas diets rich in refined carbohydrates lead to increased risk [7]. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies I and II, for example, researchers looked at the whole grain consumption of more than 160,000 women whose health and dietary habits were followed for up to 18 years. Women who averaged 2-3 servings of whole grains a day were 30% less likely to have developed type 2 diabetes than those who rarely ate whole grains. [8] When the researchers combined these results with those of several other large studies, they found that eating an extra two servings of whole grains a day decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 21%.\nWhole grains don\u2019t contain a magical nutrient that fights diabetes and improves health. It\u2019s the entire package\u2014elements intact and working together\u2014that\u2019s important. The bran and fiber in whole grains make it more difficult for digestive enzymes to break down the starches into glucose. This leads to lower, slower increases in blood sugar and insulin, and a lower glycemic index. As a result, they stress the body\u2019s insulin-making machinery less, and so may help prevent type 2 diabetes. [9] Whole grains are also rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that may help reduce the risk of diabetes.\nIn contrast, white bread, white rice, mashed potatoes, donuts, bagels, and many breakfast cereals have what\u2019s called a high glycemic index and glycemic load. That means they cause sustained spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, which in turn may lead to increased diabetes risk. [9] In China, for example, where white rice is a staple, the Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study found that women whose diets had the highest glycemic index had a 21% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, compared with women whose diets had the lowest glycemic index. [10] Similar findings were reported in the Black Women\u2019s Health Study. [11]\nMore recent findings from the Nurses Health Studies I and II and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study suggest that swapping whole grains for white rice could help lower diabetes risk: Researchers found that women and men who ate the most white rice\u2014five or more servings a week\u2014had a 17% higher risk of diabetes than those who ate white rice less than one time a month. People who ate the most brown rice\u2014two or more servings a week\u2014had an 11% lower risk of diabetes than those who rarely ate brown rice. Researchers estimate that swapping whole grains in place of even some white rice could lower diabetes risk by 36%. [12]",
        "eb469f85-eaed-4710-a5e0-3665671dd305": "2. Skip the sugary drinks, and choose water, coffee, or tea instead.\n\nLike refined grains, sugary beverages have a high glycemic load, and drinking more of this sugary stuff is associated with increased risk of diabetes. In the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II, women who drank one or more sugar-sweetened beverages per day had an 83% higher risk of type 2 diabetes, compared with women who drank less than one sugar-sweetened beverage per month. [13]\nCombining the Nurses\u2019 Health Study results with those from seven other studies found a similar link between sugary beverage consumption and type 2 diabetes. For every additional 12-ounce serving of sugary beverage that people drank each day, their risk of type 2 diabetes rose 25%. [14] Studies also suggest that fruit drinks\u2014 powdered drinks, fortified fruit drinks, or juices\u2014are not the healthy choice that food advertisements often portray them to be. Women in the Black Women\u2019s Health study who drank two or more servings of fruit drinks a day had a 31% higher risk of type 2 diabetes, compared with women who drank less than one serving a month. [15]\nHow do sugary drinks lead to this increased risk? Weight gain may explain the link. In both the Nurses\u2019 Health Study II and the Black Women\u2019s Health Study, women who drank more sugary drinks gained more weight than women who cut back on sugary drinks. [13,15] Several studies show that children and adults who drink soda or other sugar-sweetened beverages are more likely to gain weight than those who don\u2019t. [15-17] and that switching from these to water or unsweetened beverages can reduce weight. [18] Even so, weight gain caused by sugary drinks may not completely explain the increased diabetes risk. There is mounting evidence that sugary drinks contribute to chronic inflammation, high triglycerides, decreased \u201cgood\u201d (HDL) cholesterol, and increased insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for diabetes. [19]\nWhat to drink in place of the sugary stuff? Water is an excellent choice. Coffee and tea are also good calorie-free substitutes for sugared beverages (as long as you don\u2019t load them up with sugar and cream). And there\u2019s convincing evidence that coffee may help protect against diabetes; [20,21] emerging research suggests that tea may hold diabetes-prevention benefits as well, but more research is needed.\nThere\u2019s been some controversy over whether artificially sweetened beverages are beneficial for weight control and, by extension, diabetes prevention. [22] Some studies have found that people who regularly drink diet beverages have a higher risk of diabetes than people who rarely drink such beverages, [23,24] but there could be another explanation for those findings. People often start drinking diet beverages because they have a weight problem or a family history of diabetes; studies that don\u2019t adequately account for these other factors may make it wrongly appear as though the diet soda led to the increased diabetes risk. A long-term analysis on data from 40,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found that drinking one 12-ounce serving of diet soda a day did not appear to increase diabetes risk. [25] So, in moderation diet beverages can be a sugary-drink alternative for adults. \n\n\n\n\n3. Choose healthy fats.\n\nThe types of fats in your diet can also affect the development of diabetes. Healthful fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in liquid vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds can help ward off type 2 diabetes. [26] Trans fats do just the opposite. [1,27] These harmful fats were once found in many kinds of margarine, packaged baked goods, fried foods in most fast-food restaurants, and any product that listed \u201cpartially hydrogenated vegetable oil\u201d on the label. Eating polyunsaturated fats from fish\u2014also known as \u201clong chain omega 3\u201d or \u201cmarine omega 3\u201d fats\u2014does not protect against diabetes, even though there is much evidence that these marine omega 3 fats help prevent heart disease. [28] If you already have diabetes, eating fish can help protect you against a heart attack or dying from heart disease. [29]",

[28] If you already have diabetes, eating fish can help protect you against a heart attack or dying from heart disease. [29] \n\n\n\n\n4. Limit red meat and avoid processed meat; choose nuts, beans, whole grains, poultry, or fish instead.\nThe evidence is growing stronger that eating red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and processed red meat (bacon, hot dogs, deli meats) increases the risk of diabetes, even among people who consume only small amounts. A meta-analysis combined findings from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies I and II, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and six other long-term studies. The researchers looked at data from roughly 440,000 people, about 28,000 of whom developed diabetes during the course of the study. [30] They found that eating just one 3-ounce serving of red meat daily\u2014say, a steak that\u2019s about the size of a deck of cards\u2014increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 20%. Eating even smaller amounts of processed red meat each day\u2014just two slices of bacon, one hot dog, or the like\u2014increased diabetes risk by 51%.\nThe good news from this study: Swapping out red meat or processed red meat for a healthier protein source, such as nuts, low-fat dairy, poultry, or fish, or for whole grains lowered diabetes risk by up to 35%. Not surprisingly, the greatest risk reductions came from ditching processed red meat.\nHow meat is cooked may matter too. A study of three large cohorts followed for 12-16 years\u2014including more than 289,000 men and women from the Nurses\u2019 Health Studies and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study\u2014found that participants who most frequently ate meats and chicken cooked at high temperatures were 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with those who ate the least. [31] An increased risk of weight gain and developing obesity in the frequent users of high-temperature cooking methods may have contributed to the development of diabetes.\nWhy do these types of meat appear to boost diabetes risk? It may be that the high iron content of red meat diminishes insulin\u2019s effectiveness or damages the cells that produce insulin. The high levels of sodium and nitrites (preservatives) in processed red meats may also be to blame. Red and processed meats are a hallmark of the unhealthful \u201cWestern\u201d dietary pattern, which seems to trigger diabetes in people who are already at genetic risk. [32]\nFurthermore, a related body of research has suggested that plant-based dietary patterns\u00a0may help lower type 2 diabetes risk, and more specifically, those who adhere to predominantly healthy plant-based diets may have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who follow these diets with lower adherence:\n\nA 2019 meta-analysis that included health data from 307,099 participants with 23,544 cases of type 2 diabetes examined adherence to an \u201coverall\u201d predominantly plant-based diet (which could include a mix of healthy plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, but also less healthy plant-based foods such as potatoes, white flour, and sugar, and modest amounts of animal products). The researchers also looked at \u201chealthful\u201d plant-based diets, which were defined as those emphasizing healthy plant-based foods, with lower consumption of unhealthy plant-based foods. They found that people with the highest adherence to overall predominantly plant-based diets had a 23% lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those with weaker adherence to the diets. The researchers also found that the association was strengthened for those who ate healthful plant-based diets [41]",
        "554e2dec-a2b9-4b1e-a99b-4d0345f22856": "Don\u2019t smoke\nAdd type 2 diabetes to the long list of health problems linked with smoking. Smokers are roughly 50% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers, and heavy smokers have an even higher risk. [33]\nLight to moderate alcohol consumption\nEvidence has consistently linked moderate alcohol consumption with reduced risk of heart disease. The same may be true for type 2 diabetes. Moderate amounts of alcohol\u2014up to a drink a day for women, up to two drinks a day for men\u2014increases the efficiency of insulin at getting glucose inside cells. And some studies indicate that moderate alcohol consumption decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes. [1, 34-39], but excess alcohol intake actually increases the risk. If you already drink alcohol, the key is to keep your consumption in the moderate range, as higher amounts of alcohol could increase diabetes risk. [40] If you don\u2019t drink alcohol, there\u2019s no need to start\u2014you can get the same benefits by losing weight, exercising more, and changing your eating patterns.\nBeyond individual behavior\nType 2 diabetes is largely preventable by taking several simple steps: keeping weight under control, exercising more, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. Yet it is clear that the burden of behavior change cannot fall entirely on individuals. Families, schools, worksites, healthcare providers, communities, media, the food industry, and government must work together to make healthy choices easy choices.

Normal healthy cells in the body follow certain rules, growing and dividing in an orderly fashion. Eventually they die and are replaced with new cells. But sometimes old or damaged cells do not die and form an abnormal mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors may be benign, meaning that they do not invade nearby healthy tissue. But sometimes they are malignant, in which genes in the cells deviate, causing them to grow and divide erratically and spread into nearby tissues. As cancer cells continue to grow, they may break off from the original growth and travel through the blood or lymph fluid to other parts of the body. Genetic changes can be inherited, or the result of DNA damage caused by external exposures like excessive ultraviolet light or carcinogens like tobacco smoke.\nThe global burden of cancer is rising alongside the world\u2019s aging population: 1 in 5 men and 1 in 6 women worldwide develop some type of cancer during their lifetime, and 1 in 8 men and 1 in 11 women die from the disease. [1] Cancer also takes a huge economic toll. A report from the World Economic Forum and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health projected that the global cost of cancer, including medical costs, non-medical costs, and income losses, will total an estimated U.S. $458 billion in 2030. [2]\nA cancer diagnosis can also place a heavy toll on the patient and their family. Fortunately, with screening and early detection, as well as ongoing development of cancer treatments, people diagnosed with cancer are living longer than before. Even better is that many cases of cancer are preventable through a range of lifestyle changes, which may also prevent other common chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\nTypes and Risk Factors\nCancer is not just one disease. There are more than 100 types, which can start anywhere in the body. They are named by the organ or tissue in which they start growing. They can form in organs, bones, muscles, tendons, fat, blood vessels, and lymph fluid. Examples of more common types include:\n\nCarcinoma\u2014This is the most common type, which forms a solid mass of tissue (tumor). Breast, lung, and colorectal cancer are types of carcinomas.\nLeukemia\u2014This cancer starts in the blood, occurring when large numbers of abnormal white blood cells build up in the blood and bone, crowding out healthy blood cells. A lack of healthy blood cells can lower one\u2019s immune function, increasing the risk of frequent infections, fatigue, and recurrent bruising or bleeding.\nLymphoma\u2014This cancer arises in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes normally fight infection, but here they grow out of control. This can cause swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, and fatigue.\n\nThe figures below (click to enlarge) show the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths worldwide in 2020, classified by the cancer site. [3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEstimated number of new cancer cases in 2020, worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEstimated number of cancer deaths in 2020, worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nLung cancer contributes to the greatest number of new cancer cases in women and men combined. However in women, breast cancer contributes to more new cases, and slightly edges out lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths. In men, lung cancer contributes the greatest number of new cases (followed by prostate cancer) and is the leading cause of cancer deaths.",

In men, lung cancer contributes the greatest number of new cases (followed by prostate cancer) and is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Other common cancers include those of the colon and rectum, stomach, liver, pancreas, esophagus, and cervix, which, together with lung, breast, and prostate cancer account for over half of all cancer cases and deaths worldwide. The other 46% of cases and 39.5% of deaths are from a variety of other types of cancer, such as skin cancer. Learn more about cancer prevalence in this interactive tool from the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nBeyond the classification of cancer by site, tumors originating from the same tissue can have different features\u2014a distinction which can help decide the most effective treatment. For example:\n\nTumors in breast tissue have several different subtypes defined by hormone receptors, such as estrogen receptors (ER). ER-positive breast tumor cells grow in response to estrogen, and thus are more likely to be treated successfully using anti-estrogen hormone therapy than ER-negative tumor cells.\nPrimary lung cancer is divided into two main groups: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Both types behave and respond to treatment in a similar way. But small cell lung cancer is rarer and requires more immediate treatment because it tends to grow faster and spread early. The more common non-small cell lung cancer tends to develop slowly and causes fewer symptoms before it reaches later stages.\n\nHowever, cancer cells also have in common a range of abnormal features. [4] They ignore signals to stop dividing, quickly replicate, escape detection by the body\u2019s immune cells, and invade normal tissues. Cancer cells cause nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply the tumor with oxygen and nutrients, which is needed to grow.\nThis material has been reproduced from the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research.

Available at dietandcancerreport.org.\nAll cells are exposed to genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they have mechanisms to repair damage to genes and protect themselves against these hallmarks of cancer. [5] However, due to factors like aging, the environment (e.g., UV radiation), and lifestyle (e.g., poor diet, smoking), the protective mechanisms sometimes fail, leading to an increased risk of cancer development.\nPrevention\nBecause each person is exposed to unique environmental and lifestyle factors, the risk of developing cancer can vary. Although some of the risk factors cannot be controlled (such as inherited genetic mutations), there is a range of environmental and lifestyle risk factors that can be modified. Taking preventive measures can reduce the overall risk of cancer by 30-50%, which varies depending on the cancer\u2019s site of origin. [6]\nScreening\nCancer screening tests look for evidence of cancer cells or abnormal cells that may become cancer in people who do not show any symptoms. This helps to catch and remove a pre-cancer lesion and avert the cancer, or treat a potential cancer early, before it grows or spreads and causes symptoms, and which may be easier to treat. Examples of screening tests that lower the risk of dying early from cancer include:\n\nColonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or stool tests for colorectal cancer\nMammography for breast cancer\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) or pap tests for cervical cancer\nPSA tests for prostate cancer\nSkin exams for skin cancer (particularly in those at higher risk for skin cancer, such as having a prior skin cancer)\nLow-dose helical computed tomography for lung cancer (especially in people who smoke and are older than 55 years)\n\nHowever, there are sometimes downsides to screening. Individuals should discuss the pros and cons of screening tests with their doctor.\n\nScreening tests can have false-positive results (a finding that suggests cancer even though it is not), which may mean undergoing additional tests and procedures and causing increased anxiety in the patient.\nScreening tests can have false-negative results (a finding that does not find cancer even though it is present) that can delay an accurate diagnosis and earlier treatment.\nA result from a screening test may lead to \u201covertreatment\u201d of the cancer. In other words, even though a cancer may be accurately found, the type may be very slow-growing so that immediate aggressive cancer treatments are not needed though they may be prescribed.",

In other words, even though a cancer may be accurately found, the type may be very slow-growing so that immediate aggressive cancer treatments are not needed though they may be prescribed.\n\nVaccines\nVaccinations can prevent a few types of cancer caused by prolonged infection from specific pathogens. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for females ages 9 to 26 years old and males 9 to 21 years old. It protects against the HPV types that most often cause cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. [7] The hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age groups to prevent the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes hepatitis B, a serious chronic illness that can lead to liver cancer. [8] Vaccines targeting other cancer-causing viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus) are under development, but it is emphasized that vaccination should not be a substitute for routine screening according to recommended guidelines. [9,10]\nLifestyle recommendations\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a 30-40% cancer burden can be attributed to lifestyle risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. [6] That\u2019s why a lifestyle consisting of a healthy dietary pattern, weight management, and physical activity may help reduce the risk of cancer.\n See the recommendations for cancer prevention  \n\n\nReferences\n\nBray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A.

However, even for cancers with effective treatment options, prevention has the greatest potential to reduce the burden of cancer in the general population. [1]\nBecause each person is exposed to unique environmental and lifestyle factors, cancer risk can vary. Although some factors cannot be controlled (such as inherited genetic mutations), there is a range of modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors that can help reduce the risk of developing cancer.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), a 30-40% cancer burden can be attributed to lifestyle risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, overweight and obesity, and physical inactivity. [2] In a 2018 report by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR), not-for-profit organizations that lead a network of cancer prevention charities with a global reach, 10 cancer prevention recommendations on diet and nutrition were developed. These recommendations were based on the continuous update project of evidence in cancer research, which summarizes current evidence with relevant papers from randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. [3] Taken together, they promote a lifestyle consisting of a healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and weight management. This may not only help reduce the risk of cancer but may also contribute to the prevention of obesity and other chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nHere is a closer look at some of their recommendations:\nMaintain a healthy weight\nIn a meta-analysis conducted by the WCRF/AICR, there is convincing evidence that carrying extra fat mass, marked by a higher body mass index (BMI), greater waist circumference, and greater waist-to-hip ratio, significantly increases the risk of several cancers: [4]\n\nBMI measures one\u2019s weight in relation to height. A BMI between 18.5-25 is classified as normal, 25.1-29.9 overweight, and 30 or higher obese. Each increase of 5 points in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk of endometrial cancer, 48% higher risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, 30% higher risk of kidney cancer, 30% higher risk of liver cancer, 12% higher risk for postmenopausal breast cancer, 10% higher risk of pancreatic cancer, and 5% higher risk of colorectal cancer.",

People who carry more weight in the belly (apple shape) are at higher risk for cancer and other chronic diseases than those who carry more weight in the hips (pear shape). The WHO recommends a healthy WHR to be 0.9 or less in men and 0.85 or less in women. Each 0.1 unit increase in waist-hip ratio significantly increased the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma by 38%, kidney cancer by 26%, endometrial cancer by 21%, pancreatic cancer by 19%, postmenopausal breast cancer by 10%, and colorectal cancer by 2%.\n\nSignificant increasing weight in adult life is a convincing cause of\u00a0postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer.\n\nEach 11-pound increase in weight gain during adulthood was significantly associated with a 16% higher risk of endometrial cancer, and 6% higher risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.\n\nIncidence of obesity-related cancers is also rising in young adults. Researchers from the American Cancer Society collected data from 25 state cancer registries for people ages 25-84 years diagnosed with any cancer from 1995 to 2014. [5] Over this time period, incidence rates of several obesity-related cancers\u2014including colorectal, kidney, and pancreatic\u2014increased significantly in the youngest age group, ages 25-49 years (with the sharpest increases in progressively younger ages). Although the incidence of these cancers also rose in older age groups, the rate of increase was much smaller.\nBe physically active\nPhysical activity is defined as any movement that uses skeletal muscles and requires more energy than does resting. Physical activity can include working, exercising, performing household chores, and leisure-time activities such as walking, jogging, running, yoga, hiking, bicycling, and swimming.\nThere is evidence from a 2009\u00a0meta-analysis\u00a0of 52\u00a0epidemiologic studies showing that the most physically active individuals had a 24% lower risk of colon cancer than those who were the least physically active. [6] A 2013 meta-analysis of 31 prospective studies showed that the average breast cancer risk reduction associated with physical activity was 12%, and the protective effect was stronger for postmenopausal women. [7] After menopause, women who increase their physical activity may also have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who do not. [8]\nSedentary behaviors, such as spending an extended amount of time sitting, reclining, or lying down, may also increase cancer risk. [9] The review of research on sedentary behavior and risk of endometrial, colon, and lung cancers found that the highest versus lowest levels of sedentary time increased risks of these cancers by a statistically significant range of 20-35%. [10]\nEat a healthful diet\nAn overall healthy dietary pattern has the potential to lower cancer risk by 10-20%. [11] The association between diet and cancer incidence varies by cancer sites and also by sex, [12] but the recommended components of a healthy diet are often similar. The WCRF/AICR listed the following dietary recommendations to protect against cancer:\n\nLimit alcohol consumption. [13] There is strong evidence that consumption of alcoholic drinks is a cause of cancers of the mouth, pharynx and larynx, esophagus (squamous cell carcinoma), liver, colorectum, and breast (particularly postmenopause). Every 10 grams of alcohol (as ethanol) consumed per day elevated the risks of these cancers by 4-25%. The evidence shows that alcoholic drinks of all types have a similar impact on cancer risk.",

Every 10 grams of alcohol (as ethanol) consumed per day elevated the risks of these cancers by 4-25%. The evidence shows that alcoholic drinks of all types have a similar impact on cancer risk. This recommendation therefore covers all types of alcoholic drinks, whether beer, wine, spirits (liquors), or any other alcoholic drinks, as well as other alcohol sources.\nEat a diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and beans. [14] Make whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and pulses (legumes) such as beans and lentils a major part of your daily diet. There is strong evidence that eating whole grains protects against colorectal cancer, and that eating foods containing dietary fiber protects against colorectal cancer, weight gain, overweight, and obesity, which, as described above, increases the risk of many cancers.\nLimit \u201cfast\u201d foods. [15] Fast foods are readily available convenience foods that tend to be energy-dense and are often consumed in large portions. Most of the evidence on fast foods is from studies looking at burgers, fried chicken, French fries, and high-calorie drinks (containing sugar, such as soda; or unhealthy fats, such as shakes). There is strong evidence that diets containing higher amounts of fast foods and other processed foods high in unhealthy fats, starches, or sugars, as well as consuming a \u201cWestern type\u201d diet (characterized by a high amount of added sugars, meat, and fat), are causes of weight gain, overweight, and obesity, which are a risk factor for many cancers.\nLimit red and processed meat. [16,17] Red meat includes all types of muscle meat from a mammal, including beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat. Processed meat has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation. Although these products are often made from red meat (i.e., ham, salami, bacon, and some sausages such as frankfurters and chorizo), other meats can also be processed (i.e., turkey bacon, chicken sausage, and deli-sliced chicken). While both red and processed meat were suggested to increase the risk of a number of other cancers, the evidence was most convincing for colorectal cancer. The risk of colorectal cancer increased by 16% with every 50g/day of processed meat intake, and by 12% with every 100g/day of red meat intake. Because meat can be a valuable source of nutrients, in particular protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin B12, the recommendation is to limit rather than completely avoid minimally processed red meat. However, poultry and seafood are generally healthier sources of protein as well as many of these other nutrients. Very little, if any, processed meat should be consumed.\nLimit sugar-sweetened drinks. [18] There is convincing evidence that sugar-sweetened drinks is a cause of weight gain, overweight, and obesity in both children and adults, especially when consumed frequently or in large portions. As noted above, obesity increases the risk of many cancers.\n\nAvoiding tobacco and excess sun exposure\nThe recommendations also emphasize that not smoking and avoiding other exposure to tobacco and excess sun are also important in reducing cancer risk.\nCancer survivorship\nWith improved early detection and availability of more advanced treatment options, people diagnosed with cancer are living much longer. Research on the effects of diet, nutrition, and physical activity on the risk of cancer in cancer survivors is growing, but much more limited than that on risk. Therefore, the lifestyle recommendations mentioned above emphasize that all cancer survivors should receive nutritional care and physical activity guidance from trained professionals.\nAlthough evidence is not strong enough to reach firm conclusions, there are indications of links between lifestyle factors and cancer survivorship with improved quality of life and longer survival, especially for more common cancers. For example, maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, eating foods containing fiber, and having a lower intake of saturated fat appear to lead to better survival after a breast cancer diagnosis.",

A study of survivors of the 20 most common cancers revealed that, even after controlling for the overlapped risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular disease such as excessive weight and smoking, survivors of most site-specific cancers had an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases compared with that of the general population. [15] Evidence has shown that certain cancer treatments, for example anthracycline and trastuzumab, can lead to a higher risk of disease and death from cardiovascular complications.

The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.\nAlthough preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]\nWhat is a Healthy Mouth?\nThe mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.\nThroughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.\nOral Health and Nutrition: What You Eat and Drink Affects Your Teeth\nJust like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. A balanced diet with adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.\nMinerals like calcium and phosphorus contribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body).",

The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.\nOral Health and Nutrition: What You Eat and Drink Affects Your Teeth\nJust like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. A balanced diet with adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.\nMinerals like calcium and phosphorus contribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such as cheese, milk, plain yogurt, calcium-fortified tofu, leafy greens, and almonds may help tooth health. [2] While protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.\nWhen it comes to a healthy smile, fruits and vegetables are also good choices since they are high in water and fiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins like vitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, and vitamin A, another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]\nWater is the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth\u2014particularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth. Fluoride is needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.\nIs carbonated water a healthy choice for my teeth?According to available research, carbonated or \u201csparkling\u201d water, although slightly more acidic than regular water, is generally fine for your teeth. [2] While it is great to replace soda with carbonated water, it should not be used as a replacement for water with fluoride. However, not all carbonated waters are created equal. Citrus-flavored waters may have higher acid levels, increasing the risk of damage to tooth enamel. A good way to help protect your teeth is to drink these in one sitting or with meals. If you prefer drinking it without food, another option is to use a straw to help the water bypass your teeth. Remember, sparkling waters that have added sugar are sugar-sweetened beverages, which increase your risk of developing tooth decay and other chronic diseases.\nHow snacking can affect your dental healthWhat you eat and how often you eat can affect your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth and, unless removed daily, this plaque builds up. Plaque bacteria use sugar from things you eat and drink to make acid that attacks tooth enamel. This \u201cacid attack\u201d can last up to 20 minutes even after you\u2019ve finished eating or drinking. This is why snacking all day or sipping a sugary drink for a long period of time can lead to tooth decay. Excess intake of added sugars leads not only to tooth decay but is also associated with other health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. [4] Although you may not be adding that much sugar to your food, you can still be eating more sugar than you realize. This is because added sugars are often hidden. Learning about where sugar may be hiding and how to identify these added sugars can help you win this game of hide and seek.\n\nMalnutrition and oral health\nNutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person\u2019s intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.\nNutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation.",

On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.\nNutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body\u2019s immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]\nOral Health and General Health \nWhile it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]\n\n\nEndocarditis and heart disease\n\nInfective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated with heart disease and shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlled diabetes, and stress. [9,10]\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy and birth complications\nOral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.\nIf you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]",

To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]\n\n\nConditions that impact oral health\nCertain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:\n\nAnxiety and stress. Stress is a normal human reaction that everyone experiences at one point or another. However, stress that is left unchecked can contribute to many health problems including oral health issues. While behavioral changes play a leading role in these poor oral health findings, there are certain physiological effects on the body as well. Stress creates a hormone in the body called cortisol. Spikes in this hormone can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to developing periodontal disease. Evidence has shown that stress reduces the flow of saliva which in turn can contribute to dental plaque formation. [12] Certain medications like antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications can also cause dry mouth, increasing risk of tooth decay. Additionally, stress may contribute to teeth grinding (or bruxism), clenching, cold sores, and canker sores.\nOsteoporosis and Paget\u2019s Disease. Medical conditions such as osteoporosis are a fitting example of why it is so important to let your dentist know about all the medications you are taking. Certain medications like antiresorptive agents, a group of drugs that slows bone loss, can influence dental treatment decisions. That is because these medications have been associated with a rare but serious condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can damage the jawbone. Bisphosphonates (Fosamax, Actonel, and Boniva) and Denosumab (or Prolia) are examples of antiresorptive agents. Although it can occur spontaneously, ONJ more commonly occurs following surgical dental procedures like extracting a tooth or implant placement. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are taking antiresorptive agents so they can take that into account when developing your treatment plan.\n\nA healthy, pain-free mouth can lead to a better state of mind!Positive oral health can enhance mental and overall health, while neglect of oral health can negatively impact an individual\u2019s self-image and self-esteem. Poor oral health may also affect speech, which can cause or contribute to social anxiety. In this way, regular dental exams and professional cleaning not only help support positive oral health but are also vital to overall well-being and good mental health as well.\n\nEating Concerns: What to Eat If You Have\u2026 \n\n\nBraces and orthodontic treatments\nDepending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.\nIf you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.",
        "22383e5d-439d-4da0-b867-feed71fc1ecb": "Dentures\nIf you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.\n\n\n\n\nDry mouth\nDry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you\u2019re having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.\n\n\nOral Health Tips\nHere are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]\n\nDrink fluoridated water and brush with fluoride toothpaste.\nPractice good oral hygiene. Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day and floss daily between the teeth to remove dental plaque.\nVisit your dentist at least once a year (the average person should go twice a year), even if you have no natural teeth or have dentures.\nDo not use any tobacco products. If you smoke, seek resources to help you quit.\nLimit alcoholic drinks. Some alcoholic beverages can be very acidic, resulting in erosion of tooth enamel, and those with a high alcohol content can lead to dry mouth. Also be mindful of drink mixers, many of which are high in sugar and can increase the risk of tooth decay.\nIf you have diabetes, work to support control of the disease. This will decrease the risk for other complications, including gum disease. Treating gum disease may help lower your blood sugar level.\nIf your medication causes dry mouth, discuss other medication options with your doctor that may not cause this condition. If dry mouth cannot be avoided, drink plenty of water, chew sugarless gum, and avoid tobacco products and alcohol. Your oral health care provider may be able to recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications to improve your dry mouth as well.\nSee your doctor or a dentist if you experience sudden changes in taste and smell.\nWhen acting as a caregiver, help those who are not able to brush and floss their teeth independently.\nChew sugar-free xylitol gum between meals and/or when you are unable to brush after a meal.\n\nBottom Line \u2013 There Is No Health Without Oral Health \nAs growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn\u2019t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.",

Gingivitis is the mildest form, in which the gums become red, swollen, and bleed easily. Gingivitis is reversible with professional treatment and good at-home oral care. If untreated, gingivitis can advance to periodontitis where chronic inflammation causes the tissues and bone that support the teeth to be damaged. Overtime, teeth can become loose and may fall out or need to be removed.

[1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person\u2019s unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or \u201ccure\u201d their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful.\nPrecision nutrition also considers the microbiome, trillions of bacteria in our bodies that play a key role in various daily internal operations. What types and how much bacteria we have are unique to each individual. Our diets can determine which types of bacteria live in our digestive tracts, and according to precision nutrition the reverse is also true: the types of bacteria we house might determine how we break down certain foods and what types of foods are most beneficial for our bodies.\nHow Does It Work?\nPrecision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person\u2019s microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one\u2019s DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.",

Precision nutrition evaluates one\u2019s DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.\nApplying Precision Nutrition to Disease Management\nThere are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: a gluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU). However precision nutrition is in its early stages and too soon to introduce as a treatment for chronic diseases in the general population. Research is being conducted on the application of precision nutrition for obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).\nFor example, the traditional management of T2DM targets healthy lifestyle factors (exercise, diet, achieving a healthy weight), often with use of medications. Precision nutrition can further tailor diabetes management by looking closely at the following areas: [4,5]\n\nHow one\u2019s DNA may be related to the intake and metabolism of certain nutrients, which can predict how a person responds to a specific diet.\nThe measurement of metabolites (small molecules created during the breakdown and digestion of food) that reveal a person\u2019s long-term dietary patterns, whether it be eating fruits and vegetables regularly or having a high intake of saturated fat from a daily intake of meats and butter. Precision nutrition would see if there is an association between a person\u2019s metabolic \u201csignature\u201d created by these dietary patterns and their risk of developing T2DM. The metabolic testing used with precision nutrition might help to determine how a person\u2019s body would respond to a specific diet.\nDiscovering types of gut bacteria that help to improve blood glucose control, and implementing dietary patterns that change one\u2019s microbiome to support the growth and maintenance of these specific gut bacteria.\n\nApplying Precision Nutrition to Specific Foods\nPrecision nutrition examines how a person\u2019s DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup? Coffee beans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content. Research has discovered genes specifically related to coffee intake. [6] These genes may determine how fast or slowly the caffeine in coffee is metabolized. They are also associated with anti-inflammatory effects and a lower risk of certain chronic diseases. Precision nutrition uses genetic data such as this to determine if an individual would benefit from drinking more or less coffee.\nOther factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one\u2019s risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations.\nChallenges and Considerations\nThe field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges\u2014a lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual\u2019s DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided.\nPrimary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.).",

Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests.\nEthical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It\u2019s also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities.

Vitamin C and foods like citrus fruits, chicken soup, and tea with honey are popular examples. Yet the design of our immune system is complex and influenced by an ideal balance of many factors, not just diet, and especially not by any one specific food or nutrient. However, a balanced diet consisting of a range of vitamins and minerals, combined with healthy lifestyle factors like adequate sleep and exercise and low stress, most effectively primes the body to fight infection and disease.\nWhat Is Our Immune System?\nOn a daily basis, we are constantly exposed to potentially harmful microbes of all sorts. Our immune system, a network of intricate stages and pathways in the body, protects us against these harmful microbes as well as certain diseases. It recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites and takes immediate action. Humans possess two types of immunity: innate and adaptive.\nInnate immunity is a first-line defense from pathogens that try to enter our bodies, achieved through protective barriers. These barriers include:\n\nSkin that keeps out the majority of pathogens\nMucus that traps pathogens\nStomach acid that destroys pathogens\nEnzymes in our sweat and tears that help create anti-bacterial compounds\nImmune system cells that attack all foreign cells entering the body\n\nAdaptive or acquired immunity is a system that learns to recognize a pathogen. It is regulated by cells and organs in our body like the spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. When a foreign substance enters the body, these cells and organs create antibodies and lead to multiplication of immune cells (including different types of white blood cells) that are specific to that harmful substance and attack and destroy it. Our immune system then adapts by remembering the foreign substance so that if it enters again, these antibodies and cells are even more efficient and quick to destroy it.\nOther conditions that trigger an immune response \nAntigens are substances that the body labels as foreign and harmful, which triggers immune cell activity. Allergens are one type of antigen and include grass pollen, dust, food components, or pet hair. Antigens can cause a hyper-reactive response in which too many white cells are released. People\u2019s sensitivity to antigens varies widely. For example, an allergy to mold triggers symptoms of wheezing and coughing in a sensitive individual but does not trigger a reaction in other people.\nInflammation is an important, normal step in the body\u2019s innate immune response.",

People\u2019s sensitivity to antigens varies widely. For example, an allergy to mold triggers symptoms of wheezing and coughing in a sensitive individual but does not trigger a reaction in other people.\nInflammation is an important, normal step in the body\u2019s innate immune response. When pathogens attack healthy cells and tissue, a type of immune cell called mast cells counterattack and release proteins called histamines, which cause inflammation. Inflammation may generate pain, swelling, and a release of fluids to help flush out the pathogens. The histamines also send signals to discharge even more white blood cells to fight pathogens. However, prolonged inflammation can lead to tissue damage and may overwhelm the immune system.\nAutoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or type 1 diabetes are partly hereditary and cause hypersensitivity in which immune cells attack and destroy healthy cells.\nImmunodeficiency disorders can depress or completely disable the immune system, and may be genetic or acquired. Acquired forms are more common and include AIDS and cancers like leukemia and multiple myeloma. In these cases, the body\u2019s defenses are so reduced that a person becomes highly susceptible to illness from invading pathogens or antigens.\nWhat factors can depress our immune system?\n\nOlder age: As we age, our internal organs may become less efficient; immune-related organs like the thymus or bone marrow produce less immune cells needed to fight off infections. Aging is sometimes associated with micronutrient deficiencies, which may worsen a declining immune function.\nEnvironmental toxins (smoke and other particles contributing to air pollution, excessive alcohol): These substances can impair or suppress the normal activity of immune cells.\nExcess weight: Obesity is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Fat tissue produces adipocytokines that can promote inflammatory processes. [1] Research is early, but obesity has also been identified as an independent risk factor for the influenza virus, possibly due to the impaired function of T-cells, a type of white blood cell. [2]\nPoor diet: Malnutrition or a diet lacking in one or more nutrients can impair the production and activity of immune cells and antibodies.\nChronic diseases: Autoimmune and immunodeficiency disorders attack and potentially disable immune cells.\nChronic mental stress: Stress releases hormones like cortisol that suppresses inflammation (inflammation is initially needed to activate immune cells) and the action of white blood cells.\nLack of sleep and rest: Sleep is a time of restoration for the body, during which a type of cytokine is released that fights infection; too little sleep lowers the amount of these cytokines and other immune cells.\u00a0\n\nDoes an Immune-Boosting Diet Exist?\nEating enough nutrients as part of a varied diet is required for the health and function of all cells, including immune cells. Certain dietary patterns may better prepare the body for microbial attacks and excess inflammation, but it is unlikely that individual foods offer special protection. Each stage of the body\u2019s immune response relies on the presence of many micronutrients. Examples of nutrients that have been identified as critical for the growth and function of immune cells include vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, selenium, iron, and protein (including the amino acid glutamine). [3,4] They are found in a variety of plant and animal foods.\nDiets that are limited in variety and lower in nutrients, such as consisting primarily of ultra-processed foods and lacking in minimally processed foods, can negatively affect a healthy immune system. It is also believed that a Western diet high in refined sugar and red meat and low in fruits and vegetables can promote disturbances in healthy intestinal microorganisms, resulting in chronic inflammation of the gut, and associated suppressed immunity. [5]\nThe microbiome is an internal metropolis of trillions of microorganisms or microbes that live in our bodies, mostly in the intestines. It is an area of intense and active research, as scientists are finding that the microbiome plays a key role in immune function. The gut is a major site of immune activity and the production of antimicrobial proteins. [6,7] The diet plays a large role in determining what kinds of microbes live in our intestines. A high-fiber plant-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes appear to support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microbes.",

A high-fiber plant-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes appear to support the growth and maintenance of beneficial microbes. Certain helpful microbes break down fibers into short chain fatty acids, which have been shown to stimulate immune cell activity. These fibers are sometimes called prebiotics because they feed microbes. Therefore, a diet containing probiotic and prebiotic foods may be beneficial. Probiotic foods contain live helpful bacteria, and prebiotic foods contain fiber and oligosaccharides that feed and maintain healthy colonies of those bacteria.\n\nProbiotic foods include kefir, yogurt with live active cultures, fermented vegetables, sauerkraut, tempeh, kombucha tea, kimchi, and miso.\nPrebiotic foods include garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, dandelion greens, bananas, and seaweed. However, a more general rule is to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains for dietary prebiotics.\n\nChicken soup as medicine?A warm bowl of chicken soup is a popular go-to when we\u2019re feeling under the weather. Is there scientific evidence that it aids in healing? The short answer is no; there aren\u2019t any clinical trials that show that chicken soup speeds healing any more than other foods. But when breaking down its ingredients, it does appear a worthwhile remedy to try. First of all, chicken soup is light and easy on the stomach when our appetite isn\u2019t great. Second, it provides fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration, which can easily occur with a fever. Lastly, a traditional chicken soup recipe supplies various nutrients involved in the immune system: protein and zinc from the chicken, vitamin A from carrots, vitamin C from celery and onions, and antioxidants in the onions and herbs. This is one tasty and soothing food \u00a0to include when not feeling well and doesn\u2019t need a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nDo Vitamin or Herbal Supplements Help?\nA deficiency of single nutrients can alter the body\u2019s immune response. Animal studies have found that deficiencies in zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E can alter immune responses. [8] These nutrients help the immune system in several ways: working as an antioxidant to protect healthy cells, supporting growth and activity of immune cells, and producing antibodies. Epidemiological studies find that those who are poorly nourished are at greater risk of bacterial, viral, and other infections.\nSpotlight on vitamin DVitamin D\u2019s role in regulating the immune system has led scientists to explore two parallel research paths: Does vitamin D deficiency contribute to the development of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and other so-called \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases, where the body\u2019s immune system attacks its own organs and tissues? And could vitamin D supplements help boost our body\u2019s defenses to fight infectious disease, such as tuberculosis and seasonal flu?\nLearn more\nEating a good quality diet, as depicted by the Healthy Eating Plate, can prevent deficiencies in these nutrients. However, there are certain populations and situations in which one cannot always eat a variety of nutritious foods, or who have increased nutrient needs. In these cases a vitamin and mineral supplement may help to fill nutritional gaps. Studies have shown that vitamin supplementation can improve immune responses in these groups. [8-10] Low-income households, pregnant and lactating women, infants and toddlers, and the critically ill are examples of groups at risk.\nThe elderly are a particularly high-risk group. The immune response generally declines with increasing age as the number and quality of immune cells decreases. This causes a higher risk of poorer outcomes if the elderly develop chronic or acute diseases. In addition, about one-third of elderly in industrialized countries have nutrient deficiencies. [8] Some reasons include a poorer appetite due to chronic diseases, depression, or loneliness; multiple medications that can interfere with nutrient absorption and appetite; malabsorption due to intestinal issues; and increased nutrient needs due to hypermetabolic states with acute or chronic conditions.",

[8] Some reasons include a poorer appetite due to chronic diseases, depression, or loneliness; multiple medications that can interfere with nutrient absorption and appetite; malabsorption due to intestinal issues; and increased nutrient needs due to hypermetabolic states with acute or chronic conditions. Diet variety may also be limited due to budget constraints or lower interest in cooking for one person; poor dentition; mental impairment; or lack of transportation and community resources to obtain healthy food.\nA general multivitamin/mineral supplement providing the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) may be used in these cases, unless otherwise directed by one\u2019s physician. Megadose supplements (many times the RDA) do not appear justified, and can sometimes be harmful or even suppress the immune system (e.g., as with zinc). Remember that vitamin supplements should not be considered a substitute for a good diet because no supplements contain all the benefits of healthful foods.\nHerbals\u00a0\nSeveral herbal supplements have been suggested to boost immune function. What does the research say?\n\nEchinacea: Cell studies have shown that echinacea can destroy influenza viruses, but limited research in humans has been inconclusive in determining echinacea\u2019s active components. Taking echinacea after catching a cold has not been shown to shorten its duration, but taking it while healthy may offer a small chance of protection from catching a cold. [11,12]\nGarlic: The active ingredient in garlic, allicin sativum, is proposed to have antiviral and antimicrobial effects on the common cold, but high-quality clinical trials comparing garlic supplements to placebo are lacking. A Cochrane review identified only one trial of reasonable quality following 146 participants. Those taking the garlic supplement for 3 months had fewer occurrences of the common cold than those taking a placebo, but after contracting the cold virus, both groups had a similar duration of illness. [13] Note that these findings are from a single trial, which needs to be replicated.\nTea catechins: Cell studies have shown that tea catechins such as those found in green tea can prevent flu and some cold viruses from replicating and can increase immune activity. Human trials are still limited. Two randomized controlled trials found that green tea capsules produced less cold/flu symptoms or incidence of flu than a placebo; however both studies were funded or had author affiliations with tea industries. [14]\n\n8 Steps to Help Support a Healthy Immune System\n\nEat a balanced diet with whole fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of water. A Mediterranean Diet is one option that includes these types of foods.\nIf a balanced diet is not readily accessible, taking a multivitamin containing the RDA for several nutrients may be used.\nDon\u2019t smoke (or stop smoking if you do).\nDrink alcohol in moderation.\nPerform moderate regular exercise.\nAim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly. Try to keep a sleep schedule, waking up and going to bed around the same time each day. Our body clock, or circadian rhythm, regulates feelings of sleepiness and wakefulness, so having a consistent sleep schedule maintains a balanced circadian rhythm so that we can enter deeper, more restful sleep.\nAim to manage stress. This is easier said than done, but try to find some healthy strategies that work well for you and your lifestyle\u2014whether that be exercise, meditation, a particular hobby, or talking to a trusted friend. Another tip is to practice regular, conscious breathing throughout the day and when feelings of stress arise. It doesn\u2019t have to be long\u2014even a few breaths can help. If you\u2019d like some guidance, try this short mindful breathing exercise.\nWash hands throughout the day: when coming in from outdoors, before and after preparing and eating food, after using the toilet, after coughing or blowing your nose.\n\nRelated\nDiet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet\nA note on COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a range of unique and individual impacts\u2014from food access issues, income disruptions, emotional distress, and beyond.

The Healthy Eating Plate is an excellent guide for creating healthy, balanced meals, and cooking is a great way to experiment with new flavors. We offer recipes for cooking at home \u2014 whether for yourself, or your friends and family \u2014 as well as recipes for larger food service operations.\n\nTo get you started, we\u2019ve compiled helpful suggestions for how to create a healthy kitchen.\n5 Quick Tips to Stock a Healthy Kitchen\n1. Produce\nChoose locally grown vegetables and fruits whenever you can, and eat plenty every day. Aim for a variety of colors \u2014 variety is as important as quantity; no single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy.\n2. Grains\nTrade in white rice for whole grains such as barley, bulgur, oat berries, quinoa, brown rice, and more. Try perusing your local grocery store\u2019s bulk bins to discover new, delicious whole grains that are often simple to prepare.\n3. Protein\nRely on healthy protein such as fresh fish, chicken or turkey, tofu, eggs, and a variety of beans and nuts. Remember to balance your plate with lots of vegetables & fruit, whole grains and healthy fats as well.\n4. Fats and oils\nUse liquid vegetable oils whenever possible for saut\u00e9ing vegetables, stir-frying fish or chicken, and as the base of salad dressings. Good choices include canola, sunflower, corn, soybean, peanut, and olive oil.\n5. Other essentials\nEven a small amount of a high-quality ingredient can have a big impact on flavor. Stock your kitchen with high-quality basics like extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh and dried herbs, and a variety of unsalted nuts (such as walnuts, almonds, and pistachios), and you\u2019ll have flavorful building blocks for any recipe.\n\n\n\nA note about recipe development\nSome of the recipes were contributed by well-known chefs like Ming Tsai and Mollie Katzen, who collaborated with Harvard University Dining Services chefs Martin Breslin and Patty Gregory. Other recipes are from the renowned Culinary Institute of America. These contributors created colorful dishes that are both healthy and delicious.\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Set aside.\nCombine the vinegar and sugar or honey in a small bowl and mix until uniform. (You might need to warm the honey for about 10 seconds in a microwave if it\u2019s too stiff.) Set aside.\nPlace a large, deep skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Add the pecans, turn the heat down, and saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, or until the nuts are fragrant and lightly toasted. Watch them carefully so they don\u2019t burn. Transfer the nuts to another dish and set aside.\nReturn the pan to the stove, and increase the heat to medium-high. Wait about a minute, then add another tablespoon olive oil and swirl again to coat the pan. Toss in the asparagus, and stir-fry for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the asparagus is just barely tender. (Thicker asparagus will take longer.) Sprinkle in the garlic and salt during the last minute or so of cooking.\nTurn up the heat to high, and pour in the vinegar mixture, stirring as you go. Stir-fry over high heat for only about 30 seconds, then remove from heat.\nStir in the tarragon, and add black pepper to taste. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, sprinkled with the reserved pecans.",

That chewy, toothsome quality makes mushrooms a great staple for those following plant-based diets. Mushrooms owe their meatiness to chitin\u2014a polysaccharide and derivative of glucose\u2014which makes up the cell walls of most fungi. Chitin is fibrous, absorbs water well, and is tough to break down. In fact, because of that toughness, it\u2019s pretty hard to overcook mushrooms. They retain their texture even after hours of simmering. Here we pair briny, meaty oyster mushrooms with coconut for a warming dish you can whip up any night of the week. After searing the mushrooms, we simmer them in a mixture of coconut milk, garlic, and ginger. The mushrooms absorb the liquid and plump up, while retaining their meaty texture. We like these mushrooms over wild or black rice, with plenty of toasted macadamia nuts for crunch. But feel free to eat them over noodles, sweet potatoes, or just straight out of the pot.\n\nBraised Oyster Mushrooms, Coconut, and Macadamia\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 2\n\nIngredients: \n1 13.5-ounce can light coconut milk\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n8 ounces oyster mushrooms, torn into 2-inch pieces\n1 clove garlic, grated\n\u00bd-inch piece of ginger, grated\n1/4 teaspoon fish sauce (optional)\n1 cup black rice or wild rice\n1/2 cup toasted macadamia nuts, chopped\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for serving",

Stir in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in coconut milk mixture and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until mushrooms are tender and plump, 8 to 10 minutes longer. Season with fish sauce if desired and salt to taste. Set aside until ready to serve.\n Meanwhile, bring 2 cups water to boil in medium saucepan. Stir in rice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, bring to simmer, reduce heat to low, cover and cook until rice has absorbed water, 20 to 25 minutes. Fluff rice with fork, cover and set aside.\u00a0\n To serve, divide rice between two bowls. Spoon mushrooms over rice and pour coconut sauce on top. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and serve. \n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n2\n842 calories\n20 grams of protein\n77 grams of carbohydrates\n10 grams of fiber\n5 grams of sugar\n275 milligrams of sodium\n644 milligrams of potassium\n55 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t15 grams of saturated fat\n26 grams of monounsaturated fat\n10 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

It\u2019s surprisingly light yet satiating at the same time.\nIngredients\u00a0(serves 6-8 people)\n\none 3.5-4 lb. butternut squash\n1 medium leek\n1 small yellow onion\n1 medium shallot\n3 medium cloves garlic\n1 medium carrot\n1 Tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n6 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock\nblack pepper\n1/8 teaspoon kosher salt\nextra virgin olive oil\n3-4 sprigs parsley\n2-3 sprigs thyme\n10 whole black peppercorns\n2 bay leaves\nsmall bunch of chives\n1/2 cup balsamic vinegar\n1/2 cup pumpkin seeds\n\nInstructions\n\n\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut the neck off of the squash and set aside. Cut the base in half through the root and scoop out the seeds. Put 1-2 sage sprigs in each half, lightly rub in olive oil, put on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and roast until very tender, 45-60 minutes. Cool the squash down, discard the sage, and scoop out the flesh and set aside.\n\n\nPeel the next of the squash and cut into 1/2\u201d pieces. Cut the root off of the leek(s) and remove the dark green leaves, keeping only the very light-green and white parts. Take off the outer layer. Cut the leek(s) in half vertically, then into half-moon slices about 1/2\u201d wide. Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don\u2019t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain. Cut the onion, shallot, and carrot into a 1/2\u201d dice. Smash the garlic cloves and roughly chop. Wrap the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a bundle of cheesecloth and tie with a string. If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth, omit the peppercorns, and tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaves in a string bundle.",

If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth, omit the peppercorns, and tie the parsley, thyme, and bay leaves in a string bundle.\n\n\nAdd 2-3 Tablespoons of olive oil to a dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, shallot, carrot, garlic, and sweat for 5-8 minutes until translucent. Add the diced squash and cook for 4-5 minutes more. Add the honey/maple syrup and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Add the stock and herb bundle, turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat until the water is barely at a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes until the squash pieces are tender.\n\n\nAdd the roasted squash to the soup pot and simmer for another 30 minutes. Remove the herb bundle. Add about 3-4 Tablespoons of olive oil, and blend the soup in batches (or with a stick blender) until smooth. Season with kosher salt and black pepper to taste.\n\nFor balsamic reduction\n\nPut the balsamic vinegar in a small pot over very low heat. Keep the vinegar on the heat until it has reduced to a semi-thick sauce. Make sure the vinegar never comes to a boil \u2013 it can burn very easily. This will take several hours. Once it starts to thicken, keep an eye on it and swirl it around semi-regularly. It will continue to thicken off of the heat, so pull it off when it is just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\n\nFor the pumpkin seeds\n\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour the seeds into a single layer on a baking sheet, and roast for 3-6 minutes until toasted. Be careful not to burn. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.\n\nTo finish\n\nLadle soup into each bowl. Add a swirl of balsamic reduction, a few pinches of toasted pumpkin seeds, and a sprinkle of finely chopped chives.\n\nMore recipes to\u00a0Prioritize Plants for Healthy Holiday Cooking\nNutrition information per serving (1/8 of recipe):\n226 calories, 12 g protein, 37 g carbohydrate, 6 g fiber, 10 g sugar (includes 2 g added sugar),191 mg sodium, 854 mg potassium, 8 g fat (2 g sat, 3 g mono, 3 g poly, 0 g trans), 0 mg cholesterol\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

The beans contribute protein and fiber to the salad. Draining and rinsing canned beans reduces the sodium content by 40 percent. This recipe uses a few sodium-rich ingredients (e.g., anchovies and Parmesan cheese), and therefore it does not need any added salt.\n\n\nCaesar Salad\n\n\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \nFor salad\n\n6 large hearts of romaine, chopped\n\n\nFor dressing\n\n1 cup white, cannellini, or Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed\n\u00bd cup water\n2 anchovies \n4 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice\n1 garlic clove\n4 Tbsp. grated Parmesan\n\u00bd tsp. black pepper\n\u00bd cup extra virgin olive oil\n\n\nFor croutons\n\n2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil\n2 garlic cloves, finely minced\n\u00bd of an 18-inch whole wheat baguette, cubed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nCroutons: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the olive oil and minced garlic. Add the cubed baguette and toss to coat. Spread the croutons on a baking sheet and bake for 5\u20138 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown.\nDressing: In the container of a food processor combine the beans, water, anchovy, lemon juice, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil to create a creamy, emulsified dressing.\nChop heart of romaine. In a large mixing bowl combine the chopped lettuce and dressing, tossing well to ensure all of the lettuce is coated with the dressing.\nTo serve, divide the salad among six salad plates, and garnish each plate with croutons.\n\n\nNutrition information per serving (1/6 of recipe):\n375 calories, 11 g protein, 41 g carbohydrate, 11 g fiber, 3 g sugar (0 g added sugar), 447 mg sodium, 21 mg potassium, 18 g fat (3 g sat, 13 g mono, 2 g poly, 0 g trans), 1 mg cholesterol\nRecipe courtesy of Joyce Goldstein\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

It is good served either warm or cold. You can garnish with cilantro leaves and a dollop of plain yogurt to add vibrant color and even more fantastic flavor.\u00a0 Serve with your favorite sandwich and some fresh fruit. The soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days. It can also be frozen and reheated.\n\nCauliflower Tomato Soup with Indian Spices\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Amy Myrdal Miller\nCook Time 30 - 40 min.\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n2 tablespoons canola oil\n1 teaspoon coriander seeds\n1 teaspoon mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n\u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds\n\u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes\n\u00bd teaspoon ground coriander\n1 medium white or yellow onion, chopped\n1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n1 pound fresh or frozen cauliflower, cut into florets\n4 cups water\n\u00bc teaspoon kosher salt\n\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\u00bd cup plain, low-fat yogurt, for garnish\n\u00bd cup cilantro leaves, for garnish\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nIn a 4-quart stock pot combine the canola oil, coriander seeds, mustard seeds, turmeric, cumin seeds, red pepper flakes, and ground coriander. Turn heat to medium and gently warm the spices until you can hear the mustard seeds begin to pop and you begin to smell the heady aroma of the other spices.\nAdd the onions, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.\nAdd the crushed tomatoes, cauliflower, and water. Increase the heat to high, bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until the cauliflower is soft, about 20 to 25 minutes.\nRemove from heat and use an immersion blender to create a smooth, \u201ccreamy\u201d soup. Season with kosher salt and black pepper.\nGarnish, if desired, with cilantro and yogurt, and serve.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe\n130 calories\n8 grams of protein\n19 grams of carbohydrates\n5 grams of fiber\n310 milligrams of sodium\n745 milligrams of potassium",

This brassica is low in overall fiber when cooked (compared to say, carrots or broccoli), making it ideal for smooth purees and sauces. In fact, this soup is so smooth and creamy that you\u2019d be hard pressed to believe there isn\u2019t any dairy in it. And to elevate this soup even more, we blend in toasted walnuts to thicken the soup slightly. The walnuts also provide richness, a background sweetness, and a pleasant buttery quality. For some textural contrast, we serve the soup with some pan-roasted cauliflower and plenty of extra toasted walnuts.\n\nCauliflower and Walnut Soup\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n1 head cauliflower (2 pounds)\n6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 onion, halved and sliced thin\nSalt\n5 cups water\n\u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts\n\u00bd teaspoon mustard powder\n\u00bc teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon lemon juice",

Using small knife, cut around core to remove; thinly slice core and reserve. Cut 1 cup of 1/2-inch florets from head of cauliflower; set aside. Cut remaining cauliflower crosswise into 1/2-inch thick pieces.\nMelt 2 tablespoons oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onion and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 6 minutes.\nIncrease heat to high; add 4 1/2 cups water, sliced core, and half of sliced cauliflower; and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Add remaining sliced cauliflower, return to simmer, and continue to cook until cauliflower is tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer.\nWhile soup simmers, melt remaining 4 tablespoons oil in 8-inch skillet over medium heat. Add reserved florets and cook, stirring frequently, until florets are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Off heat, stir in mustard powder and cumin. Remove skillet from heat and transfer florets to small bowl. Toss florets with lemon juice and season with salt to taste.\nProcess soup and walnuts in blender until smooth, about 60 seconds. Rinse out pot. Strain pureed soup through fine-mesh strainer into pot, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Return soup to simmer over medium heat, adjusting consistency with remaining water as needed (soup should have thick, silky texture but settle flat in bowl) and seasoning with salt to taste. Serve, garnishing individual bowls with browned florets, extra walnuts, and extra olive oil.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n1 serving\n244 calories\n5 grams of protein\n9 grams of carbohydrates\n3 grams of fiber\n3 grams of sugar\n418 milligrams of sodium\n463 milligrams of potassium\n23 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t3 grams of saturated fat\n10 grams of monounsaturated fat\n2 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Here we use them in a bright, citrusy dressing with a little kick. Blending walnuts in a base of ginger, garlic, and jalapeno gives plenty of heat. And instead of mustard or mayonnaise, the walnuts help to keep the sauce smooth and homogenous as we add the oil. The result is an ultra-smooth, creamy dressing that\u2019s perfect on salads. For this dish, we like the classic combination of endive and citrus: The sweetness of oranges balances the bitter sweetness of endive, while the bright acidity of the dressing ties the flavors together. This is the perfect fancy side dish for your next dinner party, or could serve as a refreshing light lunch.\n\nEndive Salad with Citrus Walnut Dressing\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \nDressing\n\u00bd cup lime juice (about 4 limes)\n1 cup (4 ounces) toasted walnuts\n1 1-inch piece ginger\n1 clove garlic\n1 jalapeno, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces\nSalt\n1 cup cilantro leaves\n\u00bd cup parsley leaves\n\n\u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\nSalad\n\n5 belgian endive (about 4 ounces each), wilted or bruised leaves discarded\n3 cara cara or blood oranges\nFlake sea salt\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\n For the Dressing: Place lime juice, \u00bc cup (1 ounce) walnuts, ginger, garlic, jalapeno, and 1 teaspoon salt in blender and blend on high speed until smooth and frothy, about 30 seconds. Add cilantro and blend until just combined, 15 to 30 seconds longer. With blender running, drizzle in oil until smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. Strain dressing through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Transfer dressing to bowl and season with salt to taste.\n For the Salad: Cut away peel and pith from oranges. Holding fruit over bowl, use paring knife to slice between membranes to release segments; set aside. Roughly chop remaining 3/4\u00a0cup walnuts. Spoon dressing on large plate or serving bowl. Shingle endive pieces on top of sauce and scatter orange segments over endive. Sprinkle with chopped walnuts, drizzle extra dressing and olive oil, and season to taste with flake sea salt. Serve.",

It\u2019s a basic recipe that goes way back, with two types of \u201cstuffed peppers\u201d even featured in Fannie Farmer\u2019s 1896\u00a0Boston Cooking-School Cook Book.\nOf course, the idea of stuffing a bell pepper (or other pepper varieties) undoubtedly precedes this 19th-century culinary text. Recipes for stuffed peppers can be found in cuisines all over the world\u2014from Denmark\u2019s \u201cfyldte peberfrugter\u201d\u00a0(stuffed with bulgur, kale, and mushrooms) to India\u2019s \u201cbharwa shimla mich\u201d (stuffed with a mixture of spiced vegetables).\nIndeed, using a bell pepper as a vessel can yield an endless number of delicious and creative filling combinations. Plus, exploring beyond the basic beef and rice combo is a perfect way to try some\u00a0strategies to reduce red meat and elevate your plate. Stuffed peppers are also perfect for meal prep, portable for lunchboxes, and generally freeze well too if you want to make a larger batch ahead of time.\nThe \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed bell pepperIf you aren\u2019t familiar with this recipe, one serving typically packs about a quarter-pound of ground beef (saut\u00e9ed with onion and mixed with white rice, tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese) into a large bell pepper. Not really an optimal recipe for our health. Beyond the refined rice, this quantity of red meat combined with cheese serves up quite a bit of saturated fat\u2014around 18 grams worth.\nReady to get cooking? Here are a few recipe ideas to get you started:\n\nThe Upgraded Basic features minor tweaks to the basic beef, rice, and tomato version, creating a healthier recipe with no change in flavor.\nThe New\u00a0Classic sticks to the classic flavor profile, but incorporates a hearty and savory mixture of lentils and portabella mushrooms.\n\nVariations: This recipe also serves as a solid base for incorporating some favorite animal-based foods in small amounts, such as a bit of flavorful cheese or an egg baked on top of the filling.\n\n\nThe Southwestern ventures into new flavor territory with a stuffing of spicy chicken, black beans, and a\u00a0mixture of veggies.",
        "49071edd-9213-43d1-be00-df369137739b": "The Southwestern ventures into new flavor territory with a stuffing of spicy chicken, black beans, and a\u00a0mixture of veggies.\n\n\nThe Upgraded Basic\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAlthough a diet high in red meat is not optimal for our own health (or the planet\u2019s health), just a few minor tweaks can upgrade this recipe without changing the flavor if you\u2019re looking to enjoy it on occasion.\nCompared to the typical \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed bell pepper recipe, using lean ground beef at half the amount (and just a little less cheese) cuts the saturated fat per serving down to about 9 grams. You\u2019re still getting plenty of protein\u2014nearly 22 grams per serving. We also added a bit more rice, but switched to brown rice for a nutritious boost, and swapped out tomato sauce for diced tomatoes to add texture and reduce the sodium.\n\n\nSee the full recipe\n\n\n\"Upgraded Basic\" Stuffed Peppers\n\n\nIngredients: \n4 large bell peppers\n1 tablespoon olive oil \n1/2 pound lean ground beef\n1/2 cup minced white onion\n2 cups fresh diced tomatoes (or 2 14.5-oz cans unsalted diced tomatoes, drained)\n3/4 cup brown rice (yields just over 2 cups cooked)\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n*1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1 cup shredded mozzarella\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nTo prepare the rice: rinse under cold water and drain thoroughly, and cook according to package instructions.\nCut a thin slice from stem end of each pepper to remove the top. Scoop out the seeds and membrane.\nTo prepare the peppers for baking, place them in a pot and fill the base with water (fill inside peppers with some water as well to avoid floating). Bring to a boil, then reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer 3 for minutes. Remove from pot and place in ice bath. Drain.\nPreheat oven to\u00a0350 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally until softened, 2-3 minutes. Add the beef and cook, stirring occasionally until beef is cooked through (no longer pink), 6-7 minutes. Stir in cooked rice, diced tomatoes, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Remove from heat.\nStuff Peppers with filling mixture and place in a baking dish.\nBake for around 20 minutes. Peppers are ready if a toothpick or fork easily slides through the skin near the top of the pepper.\nSprinkle with shredded mozzarella and bake for around 5 more minutes.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nServes 4\n431.5 calories\n21.5 grams of protein\n40.3 grams of carbohydrates\n6.1 grams of fiber\n7.8 grams of sugar\n426.1 milligrams of sodium\n258.1 milligrams of potassium\n21.1 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t8.9 grams of saturated fat\n7.6 grams of monounsaturated fat\n0.8 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n0.5 grams of trans fat\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t57.5 milligrams of cholesterol\n\n\n\n\n\nThis recipe showcases just one of the many ways to try eating a little less red meat. You can also try swapping for a healthier meat like poultry or seafood, and explore new flavors in the process (for example, this pepper stuffed with spicy chicken and black beans). Or, you can stick with the familiar flavor profile but try some savory and hearty plant-based proteins instead.\n\nThe New Classic\u00a0\nTrue to its name, this recipe sticks to the classic taste of the \u201cbasic\u201d stuffed pepper recipe\u2014but with a new approach to those favorite flavors. Hearty lentils, savory portabella mushrooms, umami-packed tomatoes, and saut\u00e9ed onions combine with brown rice to deliver a surprisingly \u201cmeaty\u201d filling\u2014but without the red meat.\nAt 12 grams of fiber and virtually no saturated fat per serving, this new classic is a major health upgrade. (Lentils are also known for helping replace nitrogen in the soil\u2014an upgrade for the planet\u2019s health as well!)\nEven better is that this recipe provides a solid base for further modification. For example:\n\nIf you want to increase the plant-based protein content from 14 grams to 21 grams per serving, mix a half-cup of hemp seeds or hemp hearts into the filling\u2014boosting heart healthy unsaturated fats in the process.\nIf you want to incorporate a bit of your favorite animal-based protein, you can sprinkle over some flavorful cheese; or, try cracking an egg on top of the filling before baking.\n\n\n\nSee the full recipe\n\n\n\"The New Classic\" Stuffed Peppers",

Often these mixes contain miniature specimens of a greater assortment of leaves than you might otherwise purchase by the bunch (or at all). Often found in these mixes: dandelion greens, baby red mustard, tat soi, tiny kale, diminutive beet greens, and so on. Make sure they are perky and not at all wilted, and cook them that same evening, or at the very least, the next. They lose their spark if they sit around.\nRoasted garlic has a handsomely bitter flavor that is both deeper and milder than fresh garlic. Roasted and fresh team up really well together to embrace an assortment of greens.\nRemember to roast the garlic as much as several days ahead of time. Store it in a sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator until use.\u00a0 Furthermore, make this in two batches so the pan won\u2019t be crowded. Contact with the hot pan is key.\n\nGarlic-Braised Greens\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of  Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n2 medium-sized bulbs garlic (tip sliced off near the top)\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil \n8 to 10 cups or about a pound (packed) braising greens\nSalt to taste\n\u00bd to 1 teaspoon minced or crushed garlic",

Line a small baking tray with foil and brush lightly with olive oil.\nStand the garlic bulbs root side-down on the prepared tray, and drizzle the open top surfaces (where you sliced off the tops) with a little olive oil. Roast in the center of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until they feel soft when gently squeezed. Remove the tray from the oven, and let the bulbs cool until comfortable to handle. Separate the cloves, and squeeze each one over a small bowl, releasing the pulp. (Some cloves might keep their shape, while others turn to mush. All forms are welcome!)\nYou can also peel all the garlic while it is still uncooked, and wrap the cloves in a tight little foil packet, spooning in about a teaspoon of olive oil. Roast the packet for about 20 to 30 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit or until the cloves are very soft.\nStem the greens, if necessary. Leave them whole, if very small, or coarsely chop if medium-small. Your call.\nPlace a large, deep skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add half the remaining olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Toss in half of the greens, turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir-fry, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes, or until wilted. Stir in half the fresh garlic, sprinkle lightly with salt, if desired, then transfer to a medium-sized bowl, and set aside. Repeat this step with the remaining olive oil and greens.\nWhen the leaves have wilted and the fresh garlic is mixed in, reduce the heat to medium-low, and return the first batch of greens to the pan. Add the roasted garlic, turning everything together with tongs to combine. Add a little extra olive oil, if desired, and taste to adjust salt. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n130 calories\n3 grams of protein\n9 grams of carbohydrates\n3 grams of fiber\n85 milligrams of sodium\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Made with mint, cilantro, and green mango, this recipe is easy to alter\u2014you can make it solely with cilantro, you can increase the amount of chiles to make it super hot, or you can make the mint stand out by increasing its proportion in relation to the cilantro (do use some cilantro or the chutney will taste bitter). It\u2019s especially good with grilled seafood or vegetables.\n\nGreen Chutney\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Suvir Saran\nServes Makes 1 1/2 cups, or 12 servings\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup cilantro leaves and stems, chopped\n1 cup mint leaves\n1 green, unripe mango, peeled, fruit sliced away from the pit, and roughly chopped\n2\u20133 jalapeno peppers, seeded and deveined if you prefer a milder flavor\n1 2-inch long piece of ginger root, peeled and sliced\n\u00bd small red onion, peeled\nJuice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n\u00bd cup water\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nPlace all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. If the chutney doesn\u2019t blend easily, add a little water to facilitate the process\u2014keep in mind this will make the chutney milder.\nTransfer to a covered plastic container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 2 tablespoons, or 1/12 of recipe\n23 calories\n6 grams of carbohydrates\n1 grams of fiber\n195 milligrams of sodium\n75 milligrams of potassium\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Drying is an age-old preservation technique, increasing shelf life indefinitely. But drying also intensifies the flavor of mushrooms, driving off moisture and leaving precious glutamates intact. Rehydrating unlocks all of these flavors, and best of all, dried mushrooms become meatier than ever before. Here is our take on classic marinated shiitakes\u2014one of the best ways to enjoy these fungi. After rehydrating the mushrooms, we slice them to increase surface area. Simmering the mushrooms in an intense mixture of soy sauce, wine, vinegar, and plenty of the reserved cooking liquid results in ultra-meaty gems of umami goodness. These mushrooms go well with anything, from soups to stews to salads and rice bowls. We serve ours simply, with fresh, crunchy cucumber and fragrant toasted sesame seeds. This dish is perfect with steamed rice as a light lunch, or as a side dish for a bigger feast. You can find dried shiitake mushrooms at any Asian grocery store, usually in bulk.\u00a0\n\nMarinated Shiitake Mushroom and Cucumber Salad\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4-6\n\nIngredients: \nMushrooms\n4 cups (about 4 ounces) dried shiitake mushrooms\n1 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce\n3/4 cup sake or dry white wine\n1/4 cup white wine vinegar\n1/4 cup honey\n\n1 1-inch piece ginger, peeled\n\n\nSalad\n\n1 seedless English cucumber, sliced 1/4-inch thick\n1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus extra for serving\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds\nExtra-virgin olive oil",

Off heat, add mushrooms, cover, and let hydrate until mushrooms are softened and plump, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain mushrooms in fine-mesh strainer set over bowl; reserve liquid and set aside. Let mushrooms cool slightly, then cut into 1/4-inch slices. Add sliced mushrooms back to now-empty pot. Stir in 2 cups reserved cooking liquid, soy sauce, sake, vinegar, honey, and ginger until combined. Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms absorb cooking liquid and turn brown, about 30 minutes.

A sudden dip in temperature coupled with excess moisture is enough to coax these fungi out of hiding. Hen of the woods, porcinis, chicken of the woods, oyster mushrooms, and chanterelles are just a small sampling of the varieties available\u2014free of charge\u2014to the discerning woodland forager. But even if you aren\u2019t trained to mushroom-hunt on your own, wild mushrooms tend to pop up in markets when cooler weather approaches. \nHere is a simple recipe that highlights the natural nutty, earthy qualities of wild mushrooms. Pan-roasting results in crispy edges but tender, juicy interiors. To complement the earthy and savory notes of these mushrooms, we make a quick sauce of coffee and soy sauce. The bitterness of the coffee brings out the bitterness of the mushrooms, so that the mushrooms taste even more\u2026well, mushroom-y. To provide some textural contrast and sweet, buttery notes, we add in toasted hazelnuts, plus a nice dusting of grated hazelnuts for that fancy, restaurant-quality vibe. For best results, look for varieties such as hen of the woods, chicken of the woods, oyster mushrooms, or butter oyster mushrooms. For the sauce, a light to medium roast coffee works best; dark roasts tend to be too bitter for this application.\n\nPan Roasted Wild Mushrooms with Coffee and Hazelnuts\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 2\n\nIngredients: \n1/4 cup brewed coffee\n1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce\n1 teaspoon honey\n3/4 teaspoon cornstarch\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n10 ounces wild mushrooms, separated into 2- to 3-inch pieces\nSalt and pepper\n\u00bc cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped, plus extra whole for serving",

The umami flavor in certain foods comes from glutamic acid, an amino acid associated with savory or meaty flavors. Mushrooms contain a significant amount of glutamic acid and are considered an umami-rich food. Other umami-rich foods include tomatoes, aged cheeses like Parmeggiano Reggiano, and fermented foods like fish sauce and soy sauce. This recipe aggregates a number of umami-rich foods to create a savory, meat-free sandwich.\n\nPortabella Sandwiches with Umami Sauce\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \nFor umami sauce\n\n\u00bc cup mayonnaise\n1 \u00bd teaspoons reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d soy sauce\n\u00bd teaspoon Dijon-style mustard\n\n\nFor caramelized onions\n\n1 medium white or yellow onion, sliced\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n\u00bd teaspoon dried thyme\n\n\nFor portabella mushrooms\n\n4 large portabella mushroom caps, stems removed\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n3 teaspoons reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d soy sauce\n3 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\n4 whole grain rolls, toasted or warmed on the grill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nPreheat your grill to medium-high.\nIn a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, soy sauce, and mustard. Set aside\nIn a medium saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat combine the onions and olive oil. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until onions are brown and have developed caramelized flavor. Add the thyme, cook for additional 30 seconds, remove from heat, and set aside\nBrush the portabella mushroom caps with olive oil on both sides. Grill 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until tender.\nAssemble your sandwiches by placing a mushroom cap on the bottom of each bun. Top the mushroom with about \u00bc cup caramelized onions and 1 tablespoon of the umami sauce. Place the top bun on each sandwich and serve.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n280 calories\n6 grams of protein\n24 grams of carbohydrates\n4 grams of fiber\n450 milligrams of sodium\n450 milligrams of potassium\n18 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t3 grams of saturated fat\n8 grams of monounsaturated fat\n7 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t5 milligrams of cholesterol",

By making your own stock, you can control the amount of sodium and create an incredibly flavorful base for soups, stews, risottos, and other dishes that call for stock as the primary cooking liquid.\n\nRich Vegetable Stock\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of John Ash\nServes 16\n\nIngredients: \n8 cups sliced white onions\n4 cups diced carrots\n4 cups sliced leeks\n3 cups parsnips\n2 cups sliced celery stalks, including leafy tops\n\u00bc cup chopped garlic\n\u00bd cup canola oil or extra virgin olive oil\n2 gallons (32 cups) water\n3 cups dry white wine\n1 ounce dry mushrooms\n4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes\n2 teaspoons whole black pepper corns\n6 bay leaves\n2 cups parsley leaves and stems, roughly chopped\n1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nIn a large pot add the onions, carrots, celery, leeks, parsnips, garlic, and olive or canola oil, and very lightly brown over moderate heat. Add remaining ingredients, bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer partially covered for 1\u00bd hours.\nCorrect seasoning with salt and pepper, strain, cool, and refrigerate or freeze. (You can use the strained vegetables as a base for a pureed vegetable soup. Simply place the strained vegetables and some of the stock in a blender. Blend until smooth, adding stock to get the desired consistency, heat and serve.)\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1 cup, or 1/16 of recipe\n100 calories\n2 grams of protein\n4 grams of carbohydrates\n1 grams of fiber\n190 milligrams of sodium\n560 milligrams of potassium\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Line a baking tray with foil and coat with olive oil.\nSlice the squash in half lengthwise. Use kitchen scissors to loosen the seeds, then scrape them out with a spoon and discard them. Peel squash. Cut the peeled squash into 1-inch cubes, and arrange them in a single layer on the prepared tray.\nBake in the center of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes (possibly longer, depending on the type of squash and the thickness of the pieces) or until fork-tender. Try not to let them get mushy, but do make sure they are cooked through.\nTransfer to a serving bowl or platter. Taste to see if it wants to be enhanced with lemon or lime juice, and add this in small amounts, as necessary to brighten.\nServe hot, warm, or at room temperature, topped with an artful drizzle of pomegranate molasses and a scattering of pomegranate seeds.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/8 of recipe\n130 calories\n3 grams of protein\n30 grams of carbohydrates\n5 grams of fiber\n10 milligrams of sodium\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

This recipe celebrates it all! You remove the stems from the leaves and cook everything separately (enabling the stems to retain their glorious color), then recombine all the components, for a visually stunning side dish.\nChard can carry a lot of silt\u2014and then retain a lot of water on its craggy leaves\u2014so wash and dry it thoroughly before you begin.\n\nRuby Chard Decorated with Itself\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen\nServes 4-6\n\nIngredients: \n1 pound ruby chard, washed in several changes of water and thoroughly dried\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 cup minced red onion\n1/3 cup balsamic vinegar\nSalt to taste\nFreshly ground black pepper\n\u00bd cup lightly toasted pine nuts (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nUse a very sharp knife to remove the stems from the chard leaves. Coarsely chop the leaves and set them aside. Trim and discard the very tips of the stems (as well as any dinged up edges), and mince the rest.\nPlace a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. After about a minute, add about 2 teaspoons of the olive oil, and swirl to coat the pan. Toss in the chard stems and the onion, turn the heat up to medium-high, and stir-fry for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle lightly with salt, if desired, then transfer the mixture to a medium-sized bowl, and set aside.\nWithout cleaning it, return the pan to the stove over medium heat. Pour in the vinegar, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to very low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pour this slightly reduced vinegar over the stem\u2013onion mixture in the bowl.\nReturn the still-uncleaned pan to the stove over medium heat, wait another minute, then add the remaining olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Turn up the heat to medium-high, and toss in the chard leaves. Cook quickly, turning with tongs as you go, until the leaves are wilted. This will only take a couple of minutes. You can salt the leaves lightly while they cook if you wish.\nWhen the leaves are done to your liking, transfer them to a serving plate or bowl, and taste to adjust salt. Add black pepper to taste, then spoon the stem mixture over the top, being sure to include all the juices. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, topped with pine nuts, if desired.",

If you wait and then sprinkle it on top at serving, it will be more distinct. It\u2019s your call, as this is good either way. You may serve with slices of pear tucked into the side as well; tossing the pear slices with lemon juice prior to plating will help keep them from turning brown.

You can steam, boil, or stir-fry broccoli or rapini. Nina likes to blanch these types of vegetables in advance until near-tender, refresh them, and then stir-fry over very high heat just before serving.\n\nSpicy Broccolini with Red Pepper\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Nina Simonds\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n2 pounds broccolini, rapini, Chinese or western broccoli or flowering rape\n2 tablespoons virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon crushed dried chili flakes\n1 small red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into \u00bc-inch dice\n6 cloves garlic, smashed with the flat edge of a knife, skins removed, and sliced thinly\n1 teaspoon salt to taste\nJuice of \u00bd lemon, or about 2\u00bd tablespoons\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nCut away the tough end of the broccolini or rapini, and peel away the tough outer skin from the stems. Separate the stalks or tougher part of the vegetable from the more tender part (flowerets). Cut the stalks into 1-inch lengths and separate the flowerets.\nBring 3 quarts water to a boil, add the tougher part (stalks) of the vegetable and cook for about 2 minutes or until almost tender, but al dente. Add the remaining part of the vegetable and cook for another minute, or until the vegetable is tender. Drain and refresh briefly in cold water. Drain again.\nHeat a wok or a heavy skillet, add the oil, and heat until hot, about 15 seconds. Add the chili flakes, red pepper, and sliced garlic. Stir-fry over medium-high heat for 2 minutes or until the red pepper is slightly tender.\nAdd the broccolini and toss lightly over high heat to mix for a minute. Add the lemon juice and salt and toss lightly to mix. Stir together and taste for seasoning, adjusting if necessary. Scoop onto a platter or into a bowl and serve. Serve hot, at room temperature, or cold.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe\n100 calories\n5 grams of protein\n12 grams of carbohydrates\n4 grams of fiber\n240 milligrams of sodium\n5 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t1 grams of saturated fat\n3 grams of monounsaturated fat\n1 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t)",

Onion and garlic skins can also be added, but don\u2019t include the onion root.\n\n\nAdd all of the chopped vegetables and herbs to a large stock pot, and cover with cold water so that the vegetables are just submerged. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low heat so that the pot is barely simmering. Simmer for 1 hour.\n\n\nAfter 1 hour, place a colander above another soup pot or dutch oven and strain the stock into the second pot. If you want to, line the colander with cheese cloth, or swap it for a fine-mesh strainer to get a clearer stock.\n\n\nYou can reduce the veggie stock further to concentrate the flavors, or just use it as-is.\n\nMore recipes to\u00a0Prioritize Plants for Healthy Holiday Cooking\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

The filling of chickpeas and vegetables gives the pie a nice \u201cbite,\u201d making this recipe a top contender for any holiday gathering.\nIngredients (Serves 8)\n\n1/2 lb. chickpeas, dried\n2 bay leaves\n\n(or, substitute 2\u00a0 14.5oz cans of low-sodium chickpeas, drained and rinsed)\n\n\n\n\n1 lb. turnips\n1 10-oz. container cremini or button mushrooms\n2-3 medium carrots\n\n\n1 large or 2 medium leeks\n2 large stalks of celery\n2 medium cloves garlic\n3-4 sprigs sage\n2 sprigs rosemary\n4-6 sprigs thyme\n2 teaspoons cracked black pepper\n2 teaspoons tomato paste\n1/4 cup whole wheat flour\n2-4 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock\n\n\n5 lbs.\u00a0sweet potatoes\n4 egg yolks\n4 Tablespoons olive oil\nkosher salt, to taste\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n\nInstructions\n\nFor the chickpeas (omit these steps if using canned chickpeas)\n\nSoak chickpeas overnight in enough lightly salted water to cover them by 4\u201d. If you don\u2019t have the time, put the chickpeas in a pot, cover with lightly salted water (also about 4\u201d), bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let them sit for about 2 hours.\nOnce the chickpeas have soaked, combine the chickpeas, soaking liquid, and the bay leaves in a soup pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for a little over an hour, or until the chickpeas are tender but still retain a bit of texture. Strain the chickpeas and set them aside.\n\n For the carrots, turnips, and mushrooms\n\nWash everything, and cut into evenly-sized 1/2\u201d pieces. Heat an oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine vegetables, and divide into batches so the baking sheet isn\u2019t overcrowded.\nToss each batch in olive oil, and place on baking sheet. Roast each batch in the oven until browned and cooked through \u2013 this can take anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Set the roasted veggies aside when finished.\n\n To complete the filling",

Cut the leek(s) into a small dice (about 1/4\u201d pieces). Soak the leek pieces in a bowl of water for 5 minutes, then lift them out (don\u2019t pour them out) and place them in a colander to drain. Cut the celery into a small dice, and mince the garlic. Mince the herbs.\nHeat 2 Tablespoons olive oil in a 2 quart pot over medium-low heat, and add the leeks, celery, and garlic. Sweat the veggies for 5-8 minutes until translucent \u2013 keep the heat low so they don\u2019t color. Add the herbs, black pepper, and tomato paste, and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly so the tomato paste doesn\u2019t stick and burn.\nAdd 4 Tablespoons olive oil to the pot, and then the whole wheat flour. Stir the flour and continue to cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly add the vegetable stock while stirring, starting with about 2 cups. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a simmer, then add more stock if necessary to bring the sauce to a thick stew-like consistency. Remove from the heat.\nMix together the chickpeas, mushrooms, turnips, carrots, and filling \u2018base\u2019. You may not need all of the filling base \u2013 add a little at a time until you get to the desired consistency. It should be rich and fairly thick \u2013 not soupy. If needed, season to taste with kosher salt.\n\n\nHeat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Wrap each yam/sweet potato in aluminum foil, place on a baking sheet, and roast in the oven until completely soft, 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\nScoop out all of the flesh from the sweet potatoes/yams and put in a mixing bowl with the olive oil and black pepper. Mash with a big fork or potato masher. Whip the egg yolks with a little kosher salt until smooth, and add to the bowl. Mix until everything is combined.\n\nTo assemble and serve\n\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread the filling in the bottom of a 9\u00d711\u201d casserole dish. Spread the mashed sweet potatoes/yams evenly on top. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned.\n\n\nMore recipes to\u00a0Prioritize Plants for Healthy Holiday Cooking\nNutrition information per serving (1/8 of recipe):\n488 calories, 15 g protein, 87 g carbohydrate, 11 g fiber, 17 g sugar (includes 0 g added sugar), 226 mg sodium, 1279 mg potassium, 11 g fat (2 g sat, 6 g mono, 3 g poly, 0 g trans), 92 mg cholesterol\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Specifically, that savory, umami flavor comes from a naturally high concentration of glutamic acid. Glutamic acid is an amino acid that\u2019s essential to many natural chemical processes. Dissolved in water, glutamic acid separates into ions, of which the negatively charged glutamates are the real heavy-hitters. When we bite into a piece of parmesan or sip on a steamy cup of miso soup, those glutamates\u2014along with other molecules\u2014are delivering an intensely savory sensation, which we perceive as umami and delicious. But if we bite into a raw mushroom, it doesn\u2019t really taste all that savory.\nSo how do we bring out the flavor and maximize umami? One way is to use a pressure cooker. Increased temperature and pressure caramelizes and breaks down mushrooms quickly, freeing up glutamates and resulting in a more flavorful base. Here we make a quick soup by first browning the mushrooms to build flavor. Soy sauce and wine add extra sweetness and savoriness. After pressure cooking, we even double down on umami, steeping sheets of glutamate-rich kombu in our finished stock. The finished soup is rich, meaty, and intensely savory. And the best part? The cooked mushrooms still have plenty of flavor and a pleasing, tender texture. We serve this soup simply, with soba and the leftover mushrooms\u2014as well as some fresh ones. But feel free to mix it up with this one. This recipe works best with a mix of mushrooms (cremini, button, shiitake, hen of the woods, chanterelles), but it\u2019s still great if you\u2019re on a budget and only have buttons or creminis on hand.\n\nWild Mushroom Soup with Soba\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4 \n\nIngredients: \nSoup\n10 ounces mushrooms, cut into 1-inch pieces\n\u00bc cup plus 2 quarts water, divided\n\u00bc teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 clove chopped garlic\n2 tablespoons dry white wine or dry vermouth\n2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce\n1 ounce dried shiitakes \n1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n\n1 ounce kombu, broken into 4 pieces\n\n\nNoodles\n\n8 ounces soba noodles\n2 ounces enoki mushrooms, trimmed\n2 scallions, sliced thin\n4 radishes, sliced thin\nSesame oil for serving, optional",

Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until water has evaporated and mushrooms release moisture, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are well browned, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in wine and soy sauce, scraping up any browned bits, and cook until wine has evaporated, about 1 minute.\u00a0\n Stir in remaining 2 quarts water and peppercorns, lock pressure-cooker lid in place and bring to high pressure over high heat. As soon as pot reaches high pressure, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 30 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure.\n Remove pot from heat and let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure, then carefully remove lid, allowing steam to escape away from you. Return soup to simmer over low heat, stir in kombu, and cook until kombu has softened and doubled in size, about 10 minutes. Strain soup through fine mesh strainer set over bowl, pushing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve mushrooms in bowl, discarding kombu and peppercorns (Cooked peppercorns have a soft, berry-like texture. Leave them in if desired).\u00a0\n For the Noodles: Bring 2 quarts water to boil in medium pot. Add soba and cook, stirring occasionally, until just al dente, about 5 minutes. Strain soba in fine mesh strainer and divide between bowls.\n Meanwhile, bring mushroom soup, cooked mushrooms, and enoki mushrooms to simmer in now-empty pressure-cooker pot over medium-low heat. Divide soup and mushrooms between bowls. Add radishes and scallions and serve, drizzling with sesame oil if desired.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n1 serving\n400 calories\n14 grams of protein\n60 grams of carbohydrates\n6 grams of fiber\n3 grams of sugar\n986 milligrams of sodium\n746 milligrams of potassium\n15 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n4 grams of monounsaturated fat\n8 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Set the fruit on its bottom and use your knife to cut away the rest of the peel, working from the top to bottom and rotating the fruit as you go until all of the peel has been removed. You want to remove all of the white pith as well. Cut out the segments, leaving behind the membrane that separates the segments. Place the segments in a medium mixing bowl.\nDrain off any juice from the segments, and then add the mint and dressing. Use a spoon to mix gently.

Adding a small amount of intensely flavored, hard cheese like ricotta salata and a bit of sea salt, like fleur de sel, heightens these caramel flavors, making a fresh fruit salad seem like a decadent dessert.\n\nGrilled Watermelon Salad with Roasted Figs\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n2 pounds watermelon, peeled\n\u00bc cup extra virgin olive oil\n1 lime, zested and then juiced\n9 fresh figs\n2 ounces ricotta salata cheese\n2 ounces micro greens or baby greens\n2 tablespoons fig or maple syrup\n\u00bd teaspoon fleur de sel\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nPreheat your grill to medium high and preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\nCut the watermelon into small triangles about 4 inches by 3 inches and about a \u00bd-inch thick; you should have 12 pieces.\u00a0 Brush with olive oil and chill. Chill six medium-sized salad or dessert plates for serving the salad.\nZest and juice the lime and set aside 1 tablespoon of juice for dressing the greens.\nCut the figs in half and place cut side up on a sheet pan. Brush with olive oil.\u00a0 Roast for 15 minutes, or until they are soft.\nGrate the ricotta salata on a microplane or small grater and set aside in the refrigerator.\nPlace the chilled plates out on the counter and drizzle with a little of the fig or maple syrup. Grill the watermelon triangles by marking each side for about 45 seconds, repeat until you have cross-hatch marks on either side. Place two pieces of watermelon over the fig or maple syrup and arrange decoratively. Drizzle each plate with lime juice and sprinkle with a little zest.\nPlace the microgreens or baby greens in a small bowl and add the lime juice.\u00a0 Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and toss to coat. Place a small mound on each of the six plated watermelons; sprinkle with ricotta salata.\nPlace three fig halves around the salad and garnish with fleur de sel; serve immediately.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe\n230 calories\n8 grams of protein\n28 grams of carbohydrates\n3 grams of fiber\n345 milligrams of sodium\n350 milligrams of potassium\n11 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t3 grams of saturated fat\n7 grams of monounsaturated fat\n1 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t8 milligrams of cholesterol",

One strategy for incorporating more fruit into your diet is to eat fruit for dessert, or to create desserts that are mostly fruit. This dessert is an example of this strategy. Each serving of this dessert provides a full serving of fruit. The addition of whole grains, nuts, and olive oil make this a very satisfying dessert your family and guests will enjoy.\n\nStrawberry Rhubarb Crisp\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of The Culinary Institute of America\nCook Time 35 - 40 min.\nServes 12\n\nIngredients: \n6 cups fresh or frozen rhubarb (about 1 \u00bd pounds), cut into \u00bd-inch pieces\n3 cups fresh strawberries, quartered\n\u00bc cup light brown sugar\n2 teaspoons finely grated lemon or orange peel\n1 cup old-fashioned oatmeal\n\u00bd cup almond flour or finely ground almonds\n\u00bd cup brown sugar\n1/3 cup whole wheat flour\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nIn a large mixing bowl combine the rhubarb, strawberries, brown sugar, and lemon or orange zest. Toss well so all of the fruit is covered in sugar.\nSpread the fruit into an even layer on the bottom of a 9-inch by 13-inch ceramic or glass baking dish.\nIn a medium mixing bowl combine oatmeal, almond flour, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, melted butter, and olive oil. The mixture should be crumbly. Use a large spoon to sprinkle this mixture over the fruit.\nBake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes, until the topping is browned and the fruit is soft. Serve warm with a small scoop of vanilla yogurt or ice cream.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/12 of recipe\n210 calories\n3 grams of protein\n23 grams of carbohydrates\n4 grams of fiber\n6 milligrams of sodium\n320 milligrams of potassium\n15 milligrams of cholesterol\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Ancient grains like barley, farro, and wheat berries, or even brown rice provide plenty of earthy notes on their own. But with a little heat and time, these grains undergo a unique transformation: They become toasty, nutty, and take on flavors reminiscent of caramel and even umami-rich soy sauce. Here we take advantage of this idea by roasting portobello mushrooms in toasted, hulless barley grains. Wrapping the mushrooms creates steam while roasting, concentrating the barley flavors while keeping the mushrooms tender and juicy. After roasting, we blend some of the barley to create a rich, nutty sauce that gets a little extra boost from miso. We cook the rest of the roasted barley and incorporate it into a fresh fennel salad to serve along with the mushrooms. This is a complex, deeply savory mushroom dish that highlights what is possible with relatively few ingredients. Be sure to use hulless barley, as opposed to unhulled or pearled barley. For best results, use a high-powered blender in step 3.\n\nBarley Roasted Portobello and Fennel Salad\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup (7 ounces) hulless barley, toasted\n4 (4- to 6-ounce) portobello mushrooms\n1 tablespoon plus 3/4 cup vegetable oil, divided\n1 teaspoon Kosher salt\n1 bulb fennel, sliced thin, fronds reserved\n1 tablespoon white miso\n1 tablespoon lemon juice, plus extra for serving",

Line 13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and spray with baking spray. Spread barley on parchment in even layer. Brush mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil and season on both sides with salt. Place mushrooms, stem-side down on barley. Cover dish tightly with aluminum foil, crimping edges to seal. Roast mushrooms until fragrant and tender, 45 to 55 minutes. Remove foil and let mushrooms cool until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\n Transfer mushrooms to cutting board, cleaning any barley from gills. Cut mushrooms into \u00bd-inch slices and set aside. Add 1/2 cup roasted barley to pot along with 3 cups water. Bring barley to boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until barley is just tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain barley and set aside.\u00a0\n Meanwhile, transfer remaining 1/2 cup roasted barley to blender jar and blend on high speed until barley resembles coarse powder, about 2 minutes. With blender running, pour remaining 3/4 cup vegetable oil in steady stream and blend until mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes longer. Add miso and blend until smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Strain barley oil through fine-mesh strainer set over bowl, stirring solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Whisk in lemon juice until smooth and combined and set aside.\n To Serve: Combine fennel, cooked barley, and 2 tablespoons barley sauce in bowl and toss to coat evenly. Pour remaining barley sauce on large serving platter. Place fennel salad on top and drizzle with lemon juice to taste. Arrange mushrooms on fennel and drizzle with any remaining sauce. Sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n4\n534 calories\n6 grams of protein\n39 grams of carbohydrates\n7 grams of fiber\n3 grams of sugar\n497 milligrams of sodium\n294 milligrams of potassium\n47 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t7 grams of saturated fat\n10 grams of monounsaturated fat\n29 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

The muffins from this recipe weigh about 2 ounces, contain 120 calories, and are made with a mixture of whole wheat, white, and almond flour. (You don\u2019t need to buy almond flour; you can make your own almond flour by grinding whole almonds in your food processor.) All of the butter was replaced with canola oil. And the amount of fresh blueberries was doubled. Orange zest adds a zingy background note that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the blueberries. The result is a moist, flavorful blueberry muffin that will provide longer lasting energy compared to the usual coffee shop muffin.\n\n\nBlueberry Muffins\n\n\nServes 18 muffins or 30 mini muffins\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup (120 g) whole wheat pastry flour\n\u00be cup (90 g) white whole wheat flour\n\u00bc cup (26 g) almond flour\n1 tsp. (4 g) baking powder    \n\u00bd tsp. (4 g) baking soda\n\u00bd tsp.    (2 g) salt\n1 tsp. (2 g) orange zest\n1 \u00bd cups (200 g) fresh blueberries\n2 eggs\n1\u00bc cups (286 g) low fat (1%) buttermilk\n4 Tbsp. (42   g) brown sugar\n6 Tbsp. (78 g) canola oil\n1 Tbsp.   (14 g) orange juice, freshly squeezed\n\u00bd tsp. (4 g) vanilla  \n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nPlace the rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit Line muffin tins with paper liners.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and orange zest. Add the fresh blue berries and toss gently to coat the blueberries in flour. This will help keep the blueberries suspended in the batter versus falling to the bottom.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then whisk in the buttermilk, brown sugar, canola oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Don\u2019t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled or lumpy.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until most of the flour is incorporated. The mixture can be slightly lumpy; don\u2019t over mix. Divide the batter among the 18 prepared muffin cups.\nBake 12 to 14 minutes, until the muffins are golden brown around the edges.",

Cover and simmer until rice is tender and all the water is absorbed, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Stir in cabbage, red pepper, ginger, and garlic, saut\u00e9ing until peppers are tender and cabbage is just wilted. Combine the cabbage mixture with the cooked rice; add scallions, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and season with salt and pepper.\nAdd one egg white (or 2 tablespoons of packaged egg whites) and 1 tablespoon flour, and mix. Test the mixture, adding flour until you can form a small ball that stays together. If the mixture gets too dry, add a small amount of skim milk or egg white to loosen it (begin with 1 tablespoon of either skim milk or egg white).\nDrop 2-ounce balls onto a hot dry griddle and flatten gently with your palm (if the mixture sticks to your palms, you can dip your hand in water). Grill each side until the pancake is firm, about 2 minutes per side.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/12 of recipe (1 pancake)\n90 calories\n3 grams of protein\n15 grams of carbohydrates\n1 grams of fiber\n75 milligrams of sodium\n2 grams of fat\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Transfer to a small saucepan, add 1\u00bc cups water, and bring to a boil. Cover, turn the heat way down, and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and fluff thoroughly with a fork to let heat escape. Set aside. (Continue to fluff the quinoa from time to time as you prepare the other ingredients, so the grains stay dry and separate.)\nPlace the couscous in a medium-large bowl, and add the boiling water. Cover with a plate and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the plate, and fluff with a fork as you did with the quinoa. Then add the quinoa to the couscous, and fluff mightily. (It\u2019s very important to the texture of this dish that the grains be separate and \u201ctender-dry.\u201d They will borrow moisture from the other ingredients, and you don\u2019t want the salad to turn to mush.)\nMeanwhile, lightly toast the seeds in a small dry skillet over medium-low heat until they are fragrant. Cover and stir often, so they don\u2019t burn. Transfer to an electric spice grinder or a mortar and pestle. Grind to a powder, and add this to the cooked grains. Set the bowl aside until the grains have cooled at least to room temperature.\nWhen the grains have cooled, use a fork to stir in all the remaining ingredients except the optional garnishes. Cover tightly and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.\nServe cold, topped with cherry tomatoes and/or minced walnuts, and with some toasted pita bread on the side, if desired.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe, excluding optional garnishes\n350 calories\n9 grams of protein\n50 grams of carbohydrates\n6 grams of fiber\n220 milligrams of sodium\n13 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n9 grams of monounsaturated fat\n2 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

If you can only get red ones, that will be okay, too. Chopped Roma tomatoes will work as well.\n\nFantastic Bulgur Dish\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services\nCook Time 50 min.\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil \n2 cups tiny cherry tomatoes (\u00bd pound)\u2014yellow ones, if available, or diced Roma tomatoes\n\u00bd cup dried tomatoes, minced (1 ounce)\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n\u00be teaspoon salt \n1\u00bd cups coarse bulgur\n2 cups water (room temperature or warmer)\n\u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes to taste\n1 to 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice to taste\n2 to 3 teaspoons light-colored honey to taste\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted\nRoasted walnut oil\nWedges of lemon\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep nonstick skillet. Add the cherry tomatoes and saut\u00e9 over high heat for about 5 minutes.\nStir in the dried tomatoes and the salt. Continue cooking over high heat for about 2 to 3 minutes longer (cherry tomatoes might begin to pop open from the heat, and that\u2019s fine).\nTurn the heat down. Add the garlic and bulgur (and a little more oil, if it seems dry), and saut\u00e9 over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes. Stir in the water, bring to a boil, then turn the heat down as low as possible. Cover and simmer for 35 minutes or until the bulgur is tender.\nTransfer to a serving bowl, and fluff with a fork to let the steam escape so that the bulgur won\u2019t become mushy. Taste to adjust salt, then add red pepper flakes, lemon juice, honey, and black pepper to taste.\nServe hot or warm, topped with walnuts and a drizzle of roasted walnut oil, and garnish with lemon wedges.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/6 of recipe\n340 calories\n9 grams of protein\n46 grams of carbohydrates\n6 grams of fiber\n300 milligrams of sodium\n15 grams of fat",

Traditional risotto requires carnaroli or arborio rice, but there are plenty of other grains you can use. Farro is the perfect example. It\u2019s easy to cook, but doesn\u2019t turn mushy as easily as traditional rice varieties. Here we pair whole, unhulled farro with our earthy Walnut Pesto. Cracking about half the farro in a blender is key to releasing enough starch from the grains to create a creamy, risotto-like texture. To keep the grains separate, we add liquid in stages. Stirring in the pesto at the very end of cooking ensures maximum freshness and maintains a vibrant green color in the dish.\n\nFarro Risotto with Walnut Pesto\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup whole farro\n4 cups vegetable broth\n2 cups water\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 onion, minced\nSalt and pepper\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 cup dry white wine\n1 recipe Walnut Pesto\n\u2153 cup basil leaves, torn into \u00bd-inch pieces",

Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\u00a0\nStir in farro, increase the heat to medium, and cook, stirring often, until lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Stir in the wine and continue to cook, stirring often, until the wine has been completely absorbed, about 2 minutes.\u00a0\nStir in 2 cups broth mixture and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in 2 more cups of the warm broth and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is absorbed and the bottom of the pan is dry, 15 to 20 \u00adminutes longer.\nContinue to cook risotto, stirring often and adding 1/2 cup remaining broth at a time as needed to keep pan bottom from becoming dry (about every 4 minutes), until grains are cooked through but still have bite, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in 1/2 cup pesto. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

The seeds and different types of flour add flavor, texture, and fiber, making a filling, satisfying loaf that is great for sandwiches or to go with salads.\nThe basic recipe consists of water, yeast, whole wheat flour, and salt. You can add more seeds or more types of flour, or trade one type of seed or flour for another, as long the final dough is not sticky. Vitamin C helps the yeast work better. Together with lecithin and pectin, it also keeps the bread fresh longer and improves the texture.\n\nHearty Whole Grain Bread\n\nRecipe courtesy of Liesbeth Smit\nCook Time 45 min. - 1 hr. \nServes 3 small, or 2 large loaves (about 30 slices)\n\nIngredients: \n4 cups warm water (110\u2013115 degrees Fahrenheit)\n3 packets dry active yeast (1/4 ounce each)\n1/2 cup whole grain buckwheat flour\n1/2 cup whole grain barley flour\n1 cup whole grain rye flour\n4\u20135 cups whole wheat flour\n4 grams salt\nCanola oil or canola oil spray, as needed\n\n\nSeeds and Grains\n\n1 cup ground flax seeds (grind them in a coffee grinder, or buy milled flax seeds)\n1/2 cup sunflower seeds\n1/2 cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)\n3/4 cup whole rolled oats\n1/2 cup wheat bran\n\n\nBread Enhancers\n\n2 crushed 500 milligrams vitamin C supplements (any store brand)\n1 tablespoon lecithin (can be found in a natural foods store)\n1 teaspoon pectin (can be found in a natural foods store)",

Dissolve the yeast, and let it stand for a few minutes until bubbly. Add the bread enhancers (vitamin C, lecithin, and pectin) and stir. Then add the seeds, oats, and wheat bran and stir.\nAdd the buckwheat, barley, and rye flours to the water-yeast mixture, a half cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Then, add the whole-wheat flour one cup at a time, stirring, until the dough is dry enough to knead by hand. Make sure to mix in the salt with the last cup of flour, because adding salt will diminish the activity of the yeast.\nPlace the bread on a cutting board or counter top and start kneading: Fold the dough in half towards you and push away with the heels of your hands. Turn the dough one quarter turn and repeat the process for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and not sticky.\nFor the first rise, put the ball of dough in a bowl coated with oil (canola oil spray is very handy). To prevent drying, also coat the top of the dough with a thin layer of oil. Cover the bowl with a wet dish towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm environment until doubled in size, about 30\u00a0 minutes. (Placing the bread in an oven with the light on works well. You can also let the dough rise on top of the oven as it is preheating.)\nFor a lighter-textured loaf, remove the dough from the bowl, fold the dough in half twice, and place it back in the bowl, covered, to let it rise a second time. After the second rise, deflate the dough by punching it gently. Carefully cut the dough into 2 or 3 equal pieces, and put each piece of dough in an oil-coated loaf pan.\nBake at 300 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 to 60 minutes. When your kitchen smells like fresh baked bread and the bread is done, remove from the oven, turn the bread out of the pans onto a rack, and cool the loaves completely. This bread tastes great when it\u2018s toasted, and it is delicious served with hummus, guacamole, and chopped walnuts. The loaves also freeze well.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1 slice of bread (1/10 of a small loaf,\u00a01/15 of a large loaf)\n150 calories\n6 grams of protein\n25 grams of carbohydrates\n6 grams of fiber\n55 milligrams of sodium\n5 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t1 grams of saturated fat\n1 grams of monounsaturated fat\n3 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Drain well, refresh with cold water to set the color, and drain again. Chop coarsely and set aside.\nIn a large saut\u00e9 pan, add \u00bd cup of olive oil and saut\u00e9 the onion until tender, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes or sauce if using, the optional chickpeas with some of their liquid, and the greens. Heat through. This should be a bit soupy.\nSeason the shellfish with salt and pepper. You may steam them very briefly in the white wine and add the shellfish and wine to the greens. Alternately, you may add the wine along with the tomatoes and cook the shellfish directly in the pan with the greens until the shrimp turn pink, the scallops become opaque, and the squid turns white. The squid will cook in a matter of minutes. Taste the sauce and then season with salt and pepper. Toss with the cooked pasta. Serve at once.",

For mild heat, remove the seeds; for more heat, include the seeds.\nBe careful when cutting hot peppers, as the acid can burn the skin. Wear gloves when handling hot peppers, or wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Be especially careful not to touch your eyes or lips with bare or gloved hands that have handled hot peppers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nIn a medium saucepan, whisk together the rice, water, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nReduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 50 minutes or until fluffy and all the liquid is absorbed.\nMeanwhile, heat the oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and saut\u00e9 onions and jalapeno pepper until translucent and tender; do not burn. Remove from heat.\nWhen rice is finished cooking, add ginger, saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers, lime zest, and lime juice, stir to combine, and serve.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n250 calories\n5 grams of protein\n41 grams of carbohydrates\n2 grams of fiber\n15 milligrams of sodium\n9 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t4 grams of saturated fat\n3 grams of monounsaturated fat\n2 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

This tasty salad is sure to go fast, so you may even want to double the recipe!\nIngredients\u00a0(Serves 8)\n\n1 large bunch rainbow chard (or Swiss chard)\n1 large bunch kale (any kind)\n1 lb. Brussels sprouts\n1/2 lb. shiitake mushrooms\n1 Tablespoon maple syrup\n1 teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked paprika\n1 teaspoon cracked black pepper\n1 bay leaf\n1/2 cup dried wheat berries\n2 oz. fresh goat cheese (if desired)\nextra virgin olive oil\n1 large shallot\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\na few grinds of cracked black pepper\n1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt\n2 Tablespoons raw honey\n1/4 cup sherry vinegar (or cider vinegar)\n3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n\nInstructions\n\nWash the kale and chard thoroughly. If either is too tough to eat raw, wilt slightly in a pan with a little olive oil. Dry the leaves well. Tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces and set aside.\n\n\nQuarter the Brussels sprouts, removing any tough outer leaves. Heat 3 Tablespoons olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Right before the oil is about to smoke, add the Brussels sprouts to the pan in an even layer. If you can\u2019t add them all in one layer, do them in batches. Sear the Brussels sprouts, flipping around occasionally, until dark brown and roasted. Add more olive oil if needed. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.\n\n\nHeat 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a small soup pan over medium heat. Wash the wheat berries and drain off the excess water. Add the wheat berries to the pan, and toast them in the oil, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add a pinch of kosher salt, the bay leaf, and cover with about 2\u201d of water. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer them until tender, 30-40 minutes. They should begin to pop open a bit. When you taste one, it shouldn\u2019t feel hard, but it should still have a good bite to it. When the wheat berries are done, strain and set aside to cool.\n\nFor the mushroom \u201cbacon\u201d",

When the wheat berries are done, strain and set aside to cool.\n\nFor the mushroom \u201cbacon\u201d \n\n\nHeat an oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Trim the stems off of the shiitake mushrooms. Toss the caps in olive oil and kosher salt, and spread on a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet.Bake for 8-10 minutes until they start to get brown and roasted. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Mix the maple syrup, chipotle powder/paprika, and black pepper, and toss the mushrooms in the mixture until evenly coated. Return the mushrooms to the oven for 2-3 minutes until they start to crisp up again, then remove and set aside to cool on the baking sheet.\n\n\nFor the dressing\n\nCut the shallot into a small dice (1/4\u201d). Heat 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a small saute pan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot to the pan and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallot is golden brown and caramelized, about 12-15 minutes.\n\n\nAdd the shallot, mustard, black pepper, salt, honey, and vinegar to the blender, or to a cup just big enough around to fit a hand blender. Blend until fully combined. While the blender is running, slowly add the 3/4 cup of oil in a thin stream until fully incorporated. Add water if needed to thin out the dressing.\n\nTo finish\n\nAdd the goat cheese (if desired), Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, wheat berries, and about 2-4 Tablespoons dressing to a large mixing bowl. It\u2019s better to start with less dressing and add more later. Add the greens and toss the ingredients together until everything is coated with dressing and mixed well. Add extra dressing as needed.\n\n\nMore recipes to\u00a0Prioritize Plants for Healthy Holiday Cooking\nNutrition information per serving (1/8 of recipe):\n298 calories, 6 g protein, 21 g carbohydrate, 5 g fiber, 10 g sugar (includes 1.5 g added sugar), 102 mg sodium, 516 mg potassium, 23 g fat (4 g sat, 16 g mono, 3 g poly, 0 g trans),\u00a0 3 mg cholesterol\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

If the grains dry out before they are tender, add a small amount of water, as needed.\nMeanwhile, warm the olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\u00e9 until it is tender. Set aside.\nWhen the grains are tender, remove from heat.

But truth be told, you can make hummus using any number of legumes. Lentils are a perfect example: grassy and earthier than chickpeas, they lend themselves nicely to this Levantine dip. Typically, chickpeas and other beans require long cooking times and even pre-soaking in baking soda to achieve a soft enough texture for hummus. But lentils cook to the perfect consistency in a flash, no kitchen hacks required, resulting in a super smooth hummus. We keep the flavors in our version classic: plenty of tahini, lemon, fresh garlic, and a dash of cumin. To dress up the dish, we pair our hummus with a simple, bright herb salad and plenty of assorted seeds. Tuck into this hummus with some pita or lavash\u2014the perfect light dinner or party-pleasing appetizer.\n\nGreen Lentil Hummus with Herbs and Olives\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 16 quarter-cup servings (recipe makes about 4 cups)\n\nIngredients: \n1 \u00bc cups (8 \u00be ounces) green lentils, picked over and rinsed\n1 teaspoon plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided\n8 cups water\n\u00a0\n\u00bd cup plus 2 teaspoons lemon juice (4 lemons), divided\n4 cloves garlic\n\u2154 cup tahini\n\u00bc teaspoon cumin\n\u00a0\n\u00be cup fresh parsley, chopped coarse \n\u00bd cup fresh dill sprigs, chopped coarse \n\u00bd cup kalamata olives, pitted and sliced thin \n2 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided \n2 teaspoons lemon juice \nKosher salt \n2 tablespoons pepitas, toasted \n2 tablespoons unsalted sunflower seeds, toasted",
        "f2440842-b32f-4d25-9f9a-e973d36df613": "Preparation: \n\n Bring lentils, 1 teaspoon salt, and water to boil in large saucepan over high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until lentils are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain lentils and set aside.\n Meanwhile, pulse \u00bd cup lemon juice, garlic, and 2 teaspoons salt in food processor until coarse puree forms, about 20 pulses. Let steep for at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes. Add tahini to processor with lemon juice mixture and process until smooth and well combined, 45 to 60 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl and add cumin and lentils. Process until mixture is very smooth, about 4 minutes. Season with salt to taste and adjust consistency with up to 2 tablespoons additional water.\n Toss parsley, dill, olives, 2 tablespoons oil, and 2 teaspoons lemon juice together in small bowl.

Drop in a pepper flake; if the flake skips on top of the oil and doesn\u2019t burn or sink, add the rest of the pepper flakes and remove from the heat. Let the pepper flakes steep in the oil about 30 minutes, then strain and let cool. This is called olio santo, or hot pepper oil.\nWhisk the hot pepper oil and lemon juice together in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the garlic and season to taste with salt and pepper. You may need to add a little more olive oil if the hot oil is too hot. Pepper flakes vary wildly in degrees of hotness and so do people\u2019s capacities to take the heat.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 2 tablespoons\n180 calories\n20 milligrams of sodium\n20 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n15 grams of monounsaturated fat\n3 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Classic hummus doesn\u2019t contain the ingredients such as roasted peppers, spinach, artichokes, or sun-dried tomatoes seen in many supermarket brands, but if you want to add any of these to your hummus, have fun being creative! You can serve hummus with pita bread or with cucumbers, radishes, carrots, and bell peppers.\n\nHummus\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Chef Joyce Goldstein\nServes 8\n\nIngredients: \n1 \u00be cup (one 15-ounce can) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n1 cup sesame tahini (also called sesame butter)\n\u00bd cup fresh lemon juice\n2 garlic cloves, finely minced\n1 to 2 tablespoons cold water\n\u00bd teaspoon salt\n\u00bd teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground\n\u00bc teaspoon cayenne red pepper (optional)\n\u00bd teaspoon cumin, ground (optional)\n\n\nOptional garnishes:\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n3 tablespoons flat leaf parsley, chopped\n3 tablespoons pomegranate seeds\n\u00bd teaspoon cumin, ground\n\u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper or Aleppo pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nIn a food processor combine the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, water, salt, pepper, and optional spices, if desired. Pulse to combine.\nAdd the chickpeas and process until smooth. You may need to add more water if the consistency is too thick. Add enough cold water to achieve a spreadable consistency.\nWhen you\u2019re ready to serve, spoon the hummus onto a shallow plate.\u00a0Note that if you make hummus ahead of time, the mixture will thicken as it stands, in which case you may need to thin it with water. Smooth the hummus with a spoon or spatula. If desired, sprinkle with olive oil, parsley, or other optional garnishes listed.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/8 of recipe\n245 calories\n8 grams of protein\n20 grams of carbohydrates\n4 grams of fiber\n265 milligrams of sodium\n15 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n6 grams of monounsaturated fat\n7 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Drain, remove the stems and seeds and cut into small pieces. Transfer the chile pieces, or ancho chile powder, if using, to a food processor along with the nuts, garlic, roasted pepper, tomatoes, pimenton, vinegar, and salt.\nPulse a few times to make a chunky paste. Start adding the oil a tablespoon at a time until the mixture emulsifies. Taste. We are looking for sweetness from the peppers, nuttiness, and acidity.\nAdd salt if necessary to bring up the flavors. Let the sauce rest for 15 minutes for the flavors to come together, taste again and then decide if you want it spicier, saltier, or more vinegary, and adjust accordingly. The sauce keeps, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 6 months. If the oil has risen to the top you may want to re-emulsify it in the food processor, or you can remix it back to a smooth consistency with a small whisk.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/10 of recipe\n240 calories\n4 grams of protein\n6 grams of carbohydrates\n2 grams of fiber\n320 milligrams of sodium\n24 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t3 grams of saturated fat\n18 grams of monounsaturated fat\n3 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t)",

This pungent condiment goes great on everything\u2014slathered over chicken, right on top of fish, and especially mixed into pasta or rice dishes. And despite its convenience, store-bought pesto tends to be expensive and lacks the vibrancy of the homemade stuff. Here we have a riff on pesto that employs walnuts instead of more traditional pine nuts. To keep our pesto vibrant green, we blanch a mix of basil and parsley (which contains more chlorophyll), locking in the color and resulting in a pesto that stays green longer. Toasting walnuts gives our pesto an earthier, buttery flavor, while a healthy dose of pepper reinforces the pungency of basil. The resulting pesto is bold green, packs a punch, and goes great with everything\u2014though we might just as well eat it by the spoonful.\n\nWalnut Pesto\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes Makes about 1 cup\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup packed parsley\n1 cup packed basil\nSalt\n\u00bc cup walnuts\n\u00bc cup (\u00bd ounce) parmesan cheese\n3 cloves garlic\n\u00bd teaspoon pepper\n\u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nFill medium bowl with ice water. Bring 2 quarts water to boil in large saucepan over high heat; add parsley, basil, and \u00bd teaspoon salt, return to boil, and cook until herbs are bright green and wilted, about 45 seconds. Drain herbs in fine mesh strainer and transfer immediately to ice water. When herbs no longer feel warm to touch, drain in strainer again and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Transfer herbs to bowl of food processor (break up herbs with fingers to distribute evenly).\n Add walnuts, parmesan, garlic, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to food processor and pulse until finely ground, about 20 pulses. With processor running, add oil in steady stream until mixture is smooth and combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer pesto to airtight container until ready to use (pesto can be stored in refrigerator for up to one week).\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n1/4 cup\n325 calories\n4 grams of protein\n4 grams of carbohydrates\n1 grams of fiber\n195 milligrams of sodium\n167 milligrams of potassium\n35 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t5 grams of saturated fat\n21 grams of monounsaturated fat\n7 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t5 milligrams of cholesterol",

Bring this mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook at this level for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the nuts to sit in the liquid overnight.\n\nDay 2\n\nThe following day preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Drain the peanuts in a colander and pat them dry. Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet and bake them in the middle of the oven for about 30 minutes, shaking the sheet occasionally to redistribute the nuts so they will brown evenly. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and check the peanuts every 10 minutes to catch them when they are fully roasted and no longer moist in the center. Allow to cool.\nEach of the additional nuts can be toasted to their own baking sheet in the same oven until a light golden, about 15 minutes. Season lightly with salt and allow to cool.\nCombine the cooled nuts with the dried fruit and candied ginger.

One of the beautiful things about red lentils (which are actually orange, but cook up to be yellow, so the name is confusing) is that they inadvertently mash themselves. Very thoughtful of them to pitch in.\nSimmer the lentils well ahead of time. This will take about 20 to 30 minutes. While they are simmering, start cooking the onions. The onions need to be very well done in order for this dish to achieve its highest potential.\nYou have the option of \u201cspiking\u201d the olive oil with butter, which will give the dish a richer, more complex flavor. This is also perfectly fine without the butter\u2014something vegans will be glad to know.\n\nCozy Red Lentil Mash\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Mollie Katzen/Harvard University Dining Services\nServes 4 as a main dish, or 6 as a side dish\n\nIngredients: \n1-2 tablespoons olive oil (use the lesser amount if adding butter)\n2 teaspoons unsalted butter (optional)\n3 cups minced sweet onion\n2 cups uncooked red lentils\n5 cups water\n1 teaspoon salt\n2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\nBlack pepper, to taste\nCayenne (if desired)",

Add the olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Add the butter, if using, and let it melt into the olive oil. Then add the onions, shaking the pan to make sure they are distributed over the heated oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, and adding \u00bd teaspoon salt any time after the first 5 minutes or so.\nMeanwhile, combine the lentils and water in an uncovered pot or kettle. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, and let it cook undisturbed over the lowest possible heat until all the lentils are soft (approximately 10 to 30 minutes). To insure against burning the bottom, you can insert a heat-absorber underneath.\nAfter the onions have cooked for about 30 minutes, douse them with 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, mixing it in as you go. When the onions are very soft, and very sweet (about a few minutes later), add the lentils, stirring them in to combine well.\nRemove from the heat, and taste to adjust salt (it will need more) and vinegar (I usually end up adding another tablespoon or so).\nSeason with black pepper and cayenne, and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. This stores well in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator, and reheats beautifully in the microwave.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n450 calories\n27 grams of protein\n66 grams of carbohydrates\n15 grams of fiber\n610 milligrams of sodium\n6 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n4 grams of monounsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t5 milligrams of cholesterol\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Add your own favorite blend of spices and toss some chickpeas in a salad, or grab a handful for a healthy snack.\nIngredients \n\nOne 15-oz can chickpeas (garbanzo beans)\n1 Tablespoon olive oil\n1 teaspoon spice or spice blend of choice (more/less to taste)\n\nTry dried spices like chili powder, cumin, curry powder, cayenne, cinnamon, or fresh herbs such as thyme, rosemary, oregano.\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nStrain the chickpeas and rinse well, draining as much water as possible. Lay the chickpeas on a paper towel or dish cloth, and pat dry to absorb the water. For crispier chickpeas, roll the towel over the beans to remove the thin skins (this step is optional but it will further eliminate moisture when baking).\nOnce fully dry, line a baking sheet and place the chickpeas in the oven to roast for 15 minutes (avoid crowding the baking sheet, especially if doubling the recipe).\nRemove chickpeas from the oven and drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the spices, making sure they are evenly coated. Place them back into the oven and roast for another 15 minutes (you may need more or less time, just keep an eye on them so they don\u2019t burn).\nWhen done, turn off the oven and keep its door slightly open as it cools down. Note that the chickpeas will be crunchiest following roasting, but can be stored for a few days at room temperature.\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Along with yellow and white lentil varieties, red lentils are sold decorticated (with their skins removed), so they cook much quicker than do their black, brown, or green counterparts. In fact, red lentils easily cook down to mush if you\u2019re not careful, but that\u2019s a great quality to have when making soups or Indian-style daal. Here we have a hearty soup with some of those Indian influences\u2014just shy of a more authentic masoor dal\u2014using a few key pantry items. Blooming spices and tomato paste in an onion mixture creates layers of toasty flavor. And because these lentils cook and soften so quickly, there\u2019s no need for a blender or any special equipment. Instead, we simply use a whisk to lightly pulse the mixture, resulting in a soup with a pleasant, rustic texture. A splash of lemon juice gives brightness to the dish. Add a little naan or toasted bread, and salad, and you\u2019ve got a quick, simple soup makes the perfect light dinner.\n\nCurried Red Lentil Soup\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes  4-6\n\nIngredients: \n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving\n1 large onion, chopped fine\nPinch salt\n2 teaspoons curry powder\n\u00bd teaspoon ground cumin\n\u00bc teaspoon pepper\nPinch cayenne\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n1 garlic clove, minced\n4 cups chicken broth\n2 cups water\n10 \u00bd ounces (1 \u00bd cups) red lentils, picked over and rinsed\n2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus extra wedges for serving\nChopped fresh cilantro\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\n Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, cumin, pepper, and cayenne, and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in broth, water, and lentils and bring to simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and about half are broken down, about 15 minutes.\n Whisk soup vigorously until it is coarsely pureed, about 30 seconds. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt to taste. Ladle soup into individual bowls, drizzle each portion with olive oil, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve with extra lemon juice. (Soup can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Thin soup with water, if desired, when reheating.)",

But they don\u2019t have to be that way. Here\u2019s a dish of lentils prepared in the classic French style\u2014straight up, with simple aromatics and a little attention to detail. Cooking the lentils in a mixture of water, carrots, garlic, and bay leaves ensures plenty of base flavor. To keep the lentils from overcooking and to preserve their toothsome texture, we rinse the cooked lentils under cold water, washing out excess starch and stopping the cooking process. We fold the lentils and carrots back into a combination of rendered shallots, wine, stock, and a little more oil. To give some welcome brightness and a little kick, we finish the dish with a bit of whole grain mustard and a splash of red wine vinegar. This is a simple, hearty dish that\u2019s a great introduction to this versatile legume\u2014and a perfect way to stay warm on those bitter winter nights. You can use black (beluga) lentils, brown lentils, green lentils, or lentils du Puy for this recipe. Do not use red lentils or lentils with their hulls removed.\n\nFrench Style Lentils\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n1 cup black lentils, rinsed and picked over\n4 cups water\n1 carrot, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut into 4 pieces\n1 garlic clove, smashed lightly\n2 bay leaves\nSalt and pepper\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 shallot, chopped fine\n2 tablespoons sherry wine or dry white wine\n3/4 cup low-sodium vegetable broth\n2 teaspoons whole grain mustard, plus extra for serving\n2 teaspoons red wine vinegar, plus extra for serving\n1/2 cup greek yogurt \n2 tablespoons minced chives",

Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, skimming any foam off top as it rises to surface, until lentils are just cooked through and have slight bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain lentils in colander set over large bowl, reserving carrots; discard garlic and bay leaves. Chop carrots into 1/4-inch pieces and set aside. Wipe skillet clean with paper towel. Run cold water over lentils until water runs clear, about 3 changes of water. Drain lentils and set aside.\u00a0\u00a0\n Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Stir in shallots and \u00bd teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in wine and cook until liquid has nearly evaporated, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth and remaining 2 tablespoons oil, bring mixture to simmer, and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until mixture is smooth and combined, about 30 seconds. Stir in lentils and reserved carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until lentils are heated through and well coated, about 2 minutes longer. Off heat, stir in mustard and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with chives and serve, passing extra mustard and vinegar.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n1 serving\n276 calories\n12 grams of protein\n27 grams of carbohydrates\n12 grams of fiber\n4 grams of sugar\n241 milligrams of sodium\n526 milligrams of potassium\n14 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t3 grams of saturated fat\n8 grams of monounsaturated fat\n1 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t9 milligrams of cholesterol\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Cut tofu into 1-inch pieces and toss gently with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Spread the oil-coated tofu in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast in the oven until lightly browned, approximately 15 minutes. Turn with a spatula half-way through to ensure equal browning. When done, remove from the oven and set aside.\nMeanwhile, steam the green beans in a medium-size pan on the stove top until tender but slightly crispy, then shock immediately in cold water. Drain and set aside.\nWarm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan. Once heated, add the garlic and ginger, stirring to mix them together. Cook until mixture is tender, but do not burn the garlic. Add zest and chili flakes and stir again; cook for about 1 minute. Add green beans and toss to cover with garlic and ginger. Add in the tofu pieces, tossing the mixture again.\nSplash with lemon juice, toss again, taste, and season. Remove to warm serving platter and sprinkle the top with crushed peanuts.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n220 calories\n11 grams of protein\n13 grams of carbohydrates\n5 grams of fiber\n10 milligrams of sodium\n14 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t2 grams of saturated fat\n8 grams of monounsaturated fat\n4 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Soy sauce is a concentrated source of sodium. Look for reduced sodium or \u201clite\u201d versions, which contain 40 percent less sodium than traditional versions. Removing the added salt in this recipe will cut the amount of sodium per serving in half.\n\nSpicy Lemongrass Tofu with Asian Basil\n\nRecipe courtesy of Mai Pham\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n3 stalks lemongrass, finely chopped (about 5 tablespoons)\n1\u00bd tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce\n2 teaspoons chopped Thai bird chilies\n1\u00bd teaspoons ground turmeric\n2 teaspoons sugar\n12 ounces tofu, drained, cut into \u00be-inch cubes\n3 tablespoons canola oil\n1 yellow onion, cut in half and thinly sliced lengthwise\n2 tablespoons minced shallots\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\n\u00bc teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons roasted peanuts, chopped\n2/3 cup Asian basil leaves (cut large leaves in half)\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nPound the lemongrass and chilies with a mortar and pestle to pulverize them. Add soy sauce, turmeric, and sugar and mix well.\nIn a large glass bowl combine pounded aromatic mixture with the tofu and turn gently to coat evenly. Marinate for 30 minutes. (This will be a dry marinade, with not much liquid.)\nHeat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a small sauce pot over low heat. Add the onions, shallots, and garlic. Season with salt. Let cook covered 1 minute, add 1 tablespoon water, and continue to cook covered until the onions are translucent and soft\u2014approximately 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside.\nHeat remaining oil in a large 12\u201d non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the marinated tofu. (There should be enough room in the pan for all the tofu pieces to be in a single layer.) Shake pan slightly and let the tofu brown all over, using chopsticks or wooden spoons to turn the tofu pieces periodically so they cook evenly. Cook, uncovered, until tofu is nicely browned and caramelized.\nOnce the tofu is brown, add the onion mixture. Toss to warm and combine with the tofu. Adjust seasoning with a pinch of additional salt or sugar. Add half of the peanuts and Thai basil leaves. Remove from heat. Garnish with remaining peanuts and basil leaves and serve.",

To keep the salad crisp and refreshing, we salt cabbage for an hour to drain off extra moisture that would otherwise water down the dish. For an intense, savory but bright dressing, we pair toasted sesame oil and fresh lime juice. A dash of fish sauce brings a subtle funk and richness. We even add sliced celery, doubling down on the crunch factor. This slaw is perfect paired with a piece of fish or chicken, or enjoyed on its own for a light lunch.\n\nSprouted Lentil, Cabbage, and Celery Slaw\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n1 small head green cabbage, cored and chopped fine\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 cup sprouted lentils\n2 ribs celery, sliced thin\n2 scallions, sliced thin\n\u00bd cup chopped fresh cilantro\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil\n\u00bc cup lime juice (about 2 limes)\n1 tablespoon fish sauce\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, plus extra for serving\n\u00bd teaspoon ground cumin\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\n Toss cabbage and salt in colander set over medium bowl.

Toss lightly, adding another 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette as you go.\nWhen it cools to room temperature, add the cucumber, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes (if using), and some red pepper flakes to taste.

If you are making this well in advance, cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before using.\n\nFor coconut tofu strips\n\nPlace a medium-sized skillet over medium heat and wait 1 minute. Add the oil, and swirl to coat the pan.\nToss in the tofu strips with a dash or two of salt, and stir-fry (or \u201ctoss-fry\u201d) until heated through and beginning to get crispy. Sprinkle in the coconut, and if you like it a touch sweet, some sugar, and continue to cook and toss until the coconut is lightly golden and heavily aromatic.\nServe at any temperature, sprinkled on your favorite rice or vegetable dish with compatible flavors.\n\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\nPer 1/4 of recipe\n350 calories\n8 grams of protein\n18 grams of carbohydrates\n8 grams of fiber\n460 milligrams of sodium\n27 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t7 grams of saturated fat\n18 grams of monounsaturated fat\n2 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Typically, the sauce consists of roasted tomatoes, garlic, almonds, oil, and some type of pepper. For our version, a handful of toasted walnuts provides a subtle sweetness, richness, and slightly thickens the sauce to a creamy consistency. In place of roasted tomatoes, we use jarred roasted red peppers, hitting all of those sweet, umami, savory notes. A splash of sherry vinegar brightens the sauce, providing enough acidity to complement a piece of fish or meat. Here we serve our romesco with a simple, crispy-skinned piece of fish and a bright, herbaceous salad on top. Any firm-fleshed, white fish works well here: We recommend striped bass, black bass, halibut, and snapper. If you prefer a sauce with a little less acidic punch, you may substitute red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar in Step 2. And if you\u2019re having trouble finding pea shoots, arugula, watercress, or any other light leafy green will do just fine.\n\nCrispy Pan Seared White Fish with Walnut Romesco and Pea Shoot Salad\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \nFish\n4 (4- to 6-ounce) skin-on white fish fillets, 1 to 1\u00bd inches thick\nKosher salt\n\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n\nSauce\n\n1 (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained (8.5 oz dry weight)\n1 tablespoon sherry vinegar\n1 clove garlic\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n\u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n\u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts\n\n\nSalad\n\n1 small shallot, minced\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\n\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt\n\u00bc teaspoon pepper\n2 cups pea shoots, cut into 2-inch pieces\n\u00bd cup (2 ounces) toasted walnuts, chopped coarsely\n2 tablespoons mint leaves, torn into 1/2-inch pieces",

Season both sides of filets evenly with 2 teaspoons salt and place skin side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to 1\u00bd hours.\n For the Sauce: Meanwhile, place peppers, vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, smoked paprika, and cayenne in blender and blend on high speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. With blender running, slowly drizzle in oil until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add walnuts and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute longer. (For smoother sauce, strain sauce through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.) Transfer sauce to bowl and season with salt to taste.\u00a0\u00a0\n For the Salad: Whisk shallot, oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in large bowl until combined. Add pea shoots, walnuts, and mint and toss gently to combine. Season with salt to taste and set aside until ready to use.\n Remove fish from refrigerator and pat skin dry with paper towels. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Carefully slide fillets, skin side down, into skillet. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low; using fish spatula, firmly press fillets down for 20 to 30 seconds to create good contact between skin and skillet. Continue to cook, tilting skillet occasionally to distribute oil, until skin is well browned and flesh is opaque except for top \u00bc inch, 8 to 12 minutes. (If at any time during searing, oil starts to smoke or sides of fish start to brown, reduce heat so that oil is sizzling but not smoking.)\n Turn off heat. Flip fish and continue cooking until fish registers 125 degrees F/52 degrees C, about 30 seconds longer. Immediately transfer fish to large platter or wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Spoon dollops of sauce onto individual plates. Place fillets, skin side up, on top of sauce and serve with salad.\n\n\n\nNutrition facts:\n1 serving\n654 calories\n29 grams of protein\n12 grams of carbohydrates\n5 grams of fiber\n5 grams of sugar\n946 milligrams of sodium\n748 milligrams of potassium\n59 grams of fat\n\t\t\t\t (\n\t\t\t\t\t31 grams of saturated fat\n18 grams of monounsaturated fat\n7 grams of polyunsaturated fat\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t) \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Pour any remaining miso mixture over the fish. Wrap the dish in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.\nSubmerge alder wood plank in water for 2 hours before grilling.\nLight gas or charcoal grill and clean grate. Place wet plank on grate and heat for 5 minutes. Rub excess miso glaze from surface of salmon and place skin-side down on plank.\nGrill for approximately 15 to 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon filet, and how well done one desires the fish. Fifteen minutes produces fish with slightly translucent interior (about 125 degrees Fahrenheit), while twenty minutes produces fish with opaque center.\nDivide fish in two and serve with lemon slices.\nServe with saut\u00e9ed spinach and garlic, and\u00a0roasted tomatoes stuffed with seasoned goat cheese.\n\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.

Nina likes to serve this dish hot, or at room temperature with rice pilaf for a festive buffet.\n\nPan-Roasted Salmon Served with Minty Snap Peas\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Nina Simonds\nServes 6\n\nIngredients: \n6 pieces salmon fillets with skin on, each weighing about 6 ounces (For salmon marinade)\n2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger\n3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\n3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n1\u00bd pounds snap peas (For mint dressing)\n3 tablespoons fruity extra-virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons lemon juice to taste\n4 to 5 tablespoons chopped mint\n\u00bd teaspoon salt\n\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons virgin olive oil\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nMake the marinade: Mix the ginger, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar in a small bowl. Put the salmon in a deep dish. Pour in the marinade and toss lightly to coat. Let the salmon sit at room temperature while cooking the snap peas.\nBring 2 quarts of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the snap peas. Cook for 2 minutes, or until they are crisp-tender. Drain in a colander and refresh in cold water. Drain again and blot dry on paper towels.\nWhisk the mint dressing ingredients together in a mixing bowl. Add the snap peas and toss lightly to coat. Taste for seasoning, adjusting if necessary.\nHeat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over high heat until very hot. Place the salmon steaks with their coating, skin side down, in the pan, partially cover, and fry about 5 to 6 minutes covered over high heat (depending on the thickness) until the skin is crisp and the salmon meat has started becoming opaque.
