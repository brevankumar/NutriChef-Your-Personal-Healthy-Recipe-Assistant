Crisping them in a pan creates crunchy, toasty morsels that are something between popcorn, toasted nuts, and potato chips. Here we pair these crispy lentils with a simple but intense dish of poached shrimp in red curry. A splash of coconut milk rounds out the dish and gives body, and we serve the shrimp with plenty of fresh cilantro. Serve this dish with brown rice and plenty of limes for a light but satisfying dinner.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShrimp with Red Curry and Crispy Sprouted Lentils\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Tim Chin\nServes 4\n\nIngredients: \n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 cup sprouted lentils\n\u215b teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n\u00bd cup coconut milk\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n4 cloves garlic, grated\n1 2-inch piece ginger, grated\n\u00bc cup (2 ounces) red curry paste\n\u2153 cup vegetable broth\n1 \u00bd pounds fresh, shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed\n12 fresh cilantro sprigs, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces",

Remove chicken to a plate and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Reserve the marinade to make a pan sauce with later.\nIn an oven-proof saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat coated lightly with extra-virgin olive oil, sear the chicken, skin-side down, until browned. Flip chicken and finish in the oven.\nMeanwhile, make the couscous: Place couscous in large, heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water over couscous, add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir quickly to blend and immediately cover bowl with plastic wrap, sealing tightly, and allow to steam until couscous is tender, about 5 minutes.

Walnuts, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, give the dish a subtle, nutty flavor and delightful texture.\nIngredients\u00a0(Serves 8)\n\n1 medium-large yellow onion\n2 large stalks celery\n1 clove garlic\n1/2 lb. Italian chicken sausage (can be omitted for vegetarian option)\n6-8 sprigs fresh sage\n1 sprig rosemary\n2 sprigs thyme\n2 teaspoons dried sage\n2 teaspoons cracked black pepper\nextra virgin olive oil\n1 loaf whole wheat bread\n1-2 cups homemade very low-sodium vegetable stock\n1/2-3/4 cup dried cranberries\n3/4 cup walnuts, halves and pieces\n\nInstructions\n\nCut the onion and celery into a small dice (1/4\u201d). Mince the garlic. Mince the leaves of the sage, rosemary, and thyme. The fresh and dried sage is essential \u2013 the other herbs are not. Cut the bread into 3/4\u201d cubes and set aside. If using, take the casings off of the sausage.\n\n\nHeat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Arrange the walnut pieces on a baking sheet, and toast for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned.\n\n\nHeat 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan or dutch oven over medium heat. If using, put the chicken sausage in the pan, and break up into small pieces as it cooks. Cook the sausage for 8-12 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the sausage is browned. Add the onion, celery, garlic, another tablespoon of olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-low and sweat the veggies for 6-8 minutes until translucent.\n\n\nAdd the minced herbs, dried sage, and black pepper, and stir frequently for 30 seconds. Add the bread cubes and another 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook the bread cubes, stirring constantly, for 5-6 minutes until everything is evenly mixed. Start to add the stock, a little at a time, scraping the bottom of the pan as you do so. Add stock until the bread is nicely moist, but not mushy.

Remove from pan and put the mixture into a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.

Blend, working the blender in the jar until the garlic, ginger, and turmeric are smooth. Place a lid on the jar. For best results, set aside for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to develop. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nMarinate the chicken:\u00a0Place the sauce in a large zip-top bag, add the chicken, seal the bag, and massage to completely coat the chicken with the sauce. Place it in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight (or cook it immediately if you have less time).\nPrepare the stew:\u00a0Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or stovetop-safe slow cooker insert over medium heat, or in a slow cooker on the saut\u00e9 setting. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.\nStir in the chicken and sauce from the bag, carrots, sweet potatoes, apricots, water, and salt. Cook, stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, or transfer the ingredients or the slow-cooker insert to the slow cooker. Cover and simmer for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 1/2 hours on the stovetop (longer, slow cooking creates a more savory dish) or cook on low in a slow cooker for up to 8 hours or according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If desired, remove the lid for the last 15 to 30 minutes to thicken the sauce.\nServe hot (stew pictured over Cauliflower Couscous).\n\n\n\n\nRecipe from Always Delicious by David Ludwig, MD, PH & Chef Dawn Ludwig.

Beverages that are less sweet can satisfy your thirst without adding a lot of calories. This iced tea can be made exactly how you like it and is a perfect sugar-free alternative to sugary drinks.\n\nSparkling Iced Tea with Lemon, Cucumber, and Mint\n\n\nRecipe courtesy of Liesbeth Smit\nPrep Time 15 min.\nServes 2 liters\n\nIngredients: \n1 liter water\n2 tea bags (choose a green tea or an herbal tea that you like)\n2 lemons\n2 limes\n1/4 cucumber, sliced\n1 bunch fresh mint leaves\n1 liter unsweetened seltzer\nIce cubes\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation: \n\nBoil water. Let it cool for 10 minutes. Add the tea bags and half of the mint leaves and let it steep for 5 to 10 minutes. This will make a less bitter tea infusion, which is perfect for iced tea.\nSqueeze the lemons and limes, reserving a few slices for decoration. Add the lemon and lime juice to the tea infusion. When the mixture has cooled down, add the cucumber slices and the rest of the mint leaves.\nMix 1 part of the tea infusion with 1 part seltzer just before serving. Decorate with mint leaves, a lime or lemon slice,\u00a0and some cucumber slices.\n\n\n\n\nTerms of UseThe contents of this website are for educational purposes and are not intended to offer personal medical advice.
